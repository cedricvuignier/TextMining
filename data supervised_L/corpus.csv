"realDonaldTrump","after","Data: Trump<U+0091>s Anti-Globalism, Pro-Police Message Wins Over Hispanics https://t.co/syiQ2cwuwU via @BreitbartNews Great, but we also won the election!. In certain swing states, there were more votes than people who voted, and in big numbers. Does that not really matter? Stopping Poll Watchers, voting for unsuspecting people, fake ballots and so much more. Such egregious conduct. We will win!. Report: Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, Anti-Trump Hero, Paid for Flawed Coronavirus Tests from South Korea https://t.co/PHV7euutVb via @BreitbartNews. This RINO will never make the grade. Hogan is just as bad as the flawed tests he paid big money for!. Other than politics, how do you lose a case where large numbers of voters, far more than you need to flip Pennsylvania, are disenfranchised? Vote Observers thrown out of counting rooms. People going to vote finding out they have already voted through a fake ballot - go home!. Just arrived at Virtual G20. Was here yesterday also (early), but some of the Fake News Media failed to report it accurately - as usual. My speech is available (they said I didn<U+0092>t make a speech).. It<U+0092>s all about the signatures on the envelopes. Why are the Democrats fighting so hard to hide them. We will find massive numbers of fraudulent ballots. The signatures won<U+0092>t match. Fight hard Republicans. Don<U+0092>t let them destroy the evidence! https://t.co/qN2jHGeWEN. Thanks Mark. It<U+0092>s all a continuation of the never ending Witch Hunt. Judge Brann, who would not even allow us to present our case or evidence, is a product of Senator Pat <U+0093>No Tariffs<U+0094> Toomey of Pennsylvania, no friend of mine, &amp; Obama - No wonder. 900,000 Fraudulent Votes! https://t.co/17rk2KsUPs. They never thought a Vaccine could be done so soon but don<U+0092>t worry, they will try to give the credit to Biden! https://t.co/zp7vZET8R4. Sorry Liz, can<U+0092>t accept the results of an election with hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes cast, enough to easily flip the Election. You<U+0092>re just unhappy that I<U+0092>m bringing the troops back home where they belong! https://t.co/elZ9X3wrAz. Well, there were hundreds of thousands of votes cast where Republican Poll Watchers were not allowed to <U+0093>watch<U+0094>, not even allowed in the counting rooms. Likewise with Fake ballots cast and dead people voting! https://t.co/dqHIhObMLs. This is not at all frivolous. It is brought on behalf of one of the most respected members of the United States Congress who is disgusted, like so many others, by an Election that is a fraudulent mess. Fake ballots, dead people voting, no Republican Poll Watchers allowed, &amp; more! https://t.co/mOGdSOeZW8. ....the COURAGE to do what has to be done to maintain the integrity of our Elections,  and the United States of America itself. THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!. Why is Joe Biden so quickly forming a Cabinet when my investigators have found hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes, enough to <U+0093>flip<U+0094> at least four States, which in turn is more than enough to win the Election? Hopefully the Courts and/or Legislatures will have..... Fake News always <U+0093>forgets<U+0094> to mention that far fewer people are dying when they get Covid. This is do to both our advanced therapeutics, and the gained knowledge of our great doctors, nurses and front line workers!. The Fake News is not talking about the fact that <U+0093>Covid<U+0094> is running wild all over the World, not just in the U.S. I was at the Virtual G-20 meeting early this morning and the biggest subject was Covid. We will be healing fast, especially with our vaccines!. Joe Biden was a total disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu, would never have produced a Vaccine in record time (years ahead of schedule), and would do a terrible job of Vaccine delivery - But doesn<U+0092>t everybody already know that!. <U+0093>President Trump has done many great things (biggest tax &amp; regulation cuts in history, Space Force, rebuilding our military, fixing the V.A., the Wall), but perhaps the most important of all will be what he is doing now, exposing the massive corruption in our Electoral Process.<U+0094>. Watch: Hundreds of Activists Gather for <U+0091>Stop the Steal<U+0091> Rally in Georgia https://t.co/vUG1bqG9yg via  BreitbartNews  Big Rallies all over the Country. The proof pouring in is undeniable. Many more votes than needed. This was a LANDSLIDE!. This is true, but much different than reported by the media. We will show massive and unprecedented fraud! https://t.co/E1gZiqc7EP. Trump Announces Groundbreaking Rules to Lower Prescription Drug Prices https://t.co/UUrRe7oZfi via @BreitbartNews. The Governor of Georgia, and Secretary of State, refuse to let us look at signatures which would expose hundreds of thousands of illegal ballots, and give the Republican Party and me, David Perdue, and perhaps Kelly Loeffler, a BIG VICTORY.... Giuliani: The Case for Election Fraud Being Made By Americans https://t.co/yNfaKqYzCO via @BreitbartNews. RINO Mitt Romney should read this. I<U+0092>m sure, however, that he feels he got slaughtering by Obama <U+0093>fair and square<U+0094>. https://t.co/GGZKfSAp8z. Look at this in Michigan! A day AFTER the election, Biden receives a dump of 134,886 votes at 6:31AM! https://t.co/CTDaWTNs29 https://t.co/nSmc2olraF. Nolte: Top Pollster Finds 47% Say <U+0091>Likely<U+0091> Democrats Stole Election https://t.co/d8YFhFzA5w via @BreitbartNews Rigged Election!. Lawyers now on @newsmax, @OANN &amp; maybe @FoxNews. An open and shut case of voter fraud. Massive numbers!. THE COVID DRUGS NOW AVAILABLE TO MAKE PEOPLE BETTER ARE AMAZING, BUT SELDOM TALKED ABOUT BY THE MEDIA! Mortality rate is 85% down!. <U+0093>Evidence of voter fraud continues to grow, including 20,000 dead people on the Pennsylvania voters roll and many thousands all over the Country. Now, there has been an artificial number of votes in favor of Joe Biden.<U+0094> @OANN. Almost ZERO ballots rejected in Georgia this election. In years past, close to 4%. Not possible. Must have signature check on envelopes now. Very easy to do. Dems fighting because they got caught. Far more votes than needed for flip. Republicans must get tough! @BrianKempGA. Thousands of uncounted votes discovered in Georgia counties. When the much more important signature match takes place, the State will flip Republican, and very quickly. Get it done! @BrianKempGA. Important News Conference today by lawyers on a very clear and viable path to victory. Pieces are very nicely falling into place. RNC at 12:00 P.M.. ...And with these numbers, by far the highest for a sitting President, there was no way the Dems could have won, except through what we are learning now - A Rigged Election! https://t.co/9coP3R44UQ. <U+0093>Statistical sampling to prove widespread voter fraud...multiple accounts of fraud and voting irregularities may overturn election<U+0094>...call for paper ballots.  @RandPaul  @OANN. Look at this in Wisconsin! A day AFTER the election, Biden receives a dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM, when they learned he was losing badly. This is unbelievable! https://t.co/nhiLMmyHBn. The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!. In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!. <U+0093>The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance<U+0094>, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. <U+0093>There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.<U+0094> There are <U+0093>more votes than people<U+0094>. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!. The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!. They didn<U+0092>t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution! https://t.co/Q8RgaTs6ev. This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine <U+0093>glitches<U+0094> all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more! https://t.co/YDh7A7wxLW. Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don<U+0092>t Harass! https://t.co/n5frpesHfD. Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don<U+0092>t have a clue! https://t.co/j10ZRZpYjK. Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!. The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually<U+00A0>impenetrable<U+00A0>by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!. ...votes from Trump to Biden, late voting, and many more. Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as<U+00A0>Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.. The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud - including dead people voting, Poll Watchers not allowed into polling locations, <U+0093>glitches<U+0094> in the voting machines which changed.... I have reversed the ridiculous decision to cancel Wreaths Across America at Arlington National Cemetery. It will now go on!. Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact! https://t.co/TLHnFKNN6g. The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X<U+0092>s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016.<U+00A0>This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the <U+0093>SACRED<U+0094> vote counting rooms!
https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4. Georgia won<U+0092>t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA. European Countries are sadly getting clobbered by the China Virus. The Fake News does not like reporting this!. The Radical Left Democrats, working with their partner, the Fake News Media, are trying to STEAL this Election. We won<U+0092>t let them!. Trump Campaign Rejects Media Reports of Changed Pennsylvania Case https://t.co/VjIhiyB4XK via @BreitbartNews. Just more Fake News. Harassment and exclusion of our Poll Watchers is a big part of our case. Unconstitutional!. Another Vaccine just announced. This time by Moderna, 95% effective. For those great <U+0093>historians<U+0094>, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!. The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!. The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint! https://t.co/Rhc4RY0QSF. ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!. ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left. Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,... A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the <U+0093>hottest<U+0094>, most advanced, space center in the world, by far! https://t.co/CDCGdO74Yb. Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!. WATCH: D.C. Cops Direct Trump-Supporters into Gauntlet of Protesters, Do Nothing When They Are Assaulted https://t.co/179yDCbZou via @BreitbartNews. These thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town. Ran away earlier!. John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I<U+0092>ve had the <U+0093>pleasure<U+0094> to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, <U+0093>Gee, let<U+0092>s go to war.<U+0094> Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!. He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!. Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!. All of the mechanical <U+0093>glitches<U+0094> that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!. He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn<U+0092>t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more! https://t.co/Exb3C1mAPg. Doing a great job in Georgia. Their recount is a scam, means nothing. Must see fraudulent signatures which is prohibited by stupidly signed &amp; unconstitutional consent decree. @BrianKempGA https://t.co/UtEp3FN22S. This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana<U+0092>s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others! https://t.co/ewHE8GBRNy. Tax filings reveal Biden cancer charity spent millions on salaries, zero on research https://t.co/2DhE1Ddt6y via @nypost. The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country! https://t.co/wVsDx6GeGc. Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION! https://t.co/X2sQFeDZlq. Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!. ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going <U+0097> do your job and don<U+0092>t hold back!!!. I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!. There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!. .@FoxNews and the Fake News Networks aren<U+0092>t showing these massive gatherings. Instead they have their reporters standing in almost empty streets. We now have SUPPRESSION BY THE PRESS. MAGA! https://t.co/RMOa4jKZwA. The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don<U+0092>t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!. Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election! https://t.co/tr35WKTKM8. People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons! https://t.co/RMOa4jKZwA. ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!. I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW.... Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!. The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!. Republican Burgess Owens Defeats Democrat Rep. Ben McAdams in Utah https://t.co/H9NlPQj5yb via @BreitbartNews Great going Burgess, you continue to be a STAR!. Top US Pollster and Statistician Richard Baris <U+0097> People's Pundit <U+0097> SUSPENDED from Twitter for Reporting on Disputed Election <U+0097> Political 'WrongThink' Not Allowed https://t.co/uHBZnJJn1I via Said 10,000 DEAD PEOPLE VOTED IN MICHIGAN. When will this RIGGED ELECTION be overturned!. <U+0093>The worst thing you can do is bet against Donald Trump, considering what has been done against him. They flooded the zone with mail-in ballots. We need every vote counted, and ferociously.<U+0094> @PeteHegseth @seanhannity. Georgia Secretary of State, a so-called Republican (RINO), won<U+0092>t let the people checking the ballots see the signatures for fraud. Why? Without this the whole process is very unfair and close to meaningless. Everyone knows that we won the state. Where is @BrianKempGA?. 700,000 ballots were not allowed to be viewed in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh which means, based on our great Constitution, we win the State of Pennsylvania!. <U+0093>VICTOR JOECKS: Clark County election officials accepted my signature <U+0097> on 8 ballot envelopes<U+0094> https://t.co/T6vTcb4k6k. Now it is learned that the horrendous Dominion Voting System was used in Arizona (and big in Nevada). No wonder the result was a very close loss!. Heartwarming to see all of the tremendous support out there, especially the organic Rallies that are springing up all over the Country, including a big one on Saturday in D.C. I may even try to stop by and say hello. This Election was Rigged, from Dominion all the way up &amp; down!. For years the Dems have been preaching how unsafe and rigged our elections have been. Now they are saying what a wonderful job the Trump Administration did in making 2020 the most secure election ever. Actually this is true, except for what the Democrats did. Rigged Election!. Alito: <U+0091>Religious Liberty Is in Danger of Becoming a Second-Class Right<U+0091> https://t.co/hJZJHb36PB via @BreitbartNews. These states in question should immediately be put in the Trump Win column. Biden did not win, he lost by a lot! https://t.co/ywiw6sPicI https://t.co/C1g9LZpMah. Must see @seanhannity takedown of the horrible, inaccurate and anything but secure Dominion Voting System which is used in States where tens of thousands of votes were stolen from us and given to Biden. Likewise, the Great @LouDobbs has a confirming and powerful piece!. <U+0093>REPORT: DOMINION DELETED 2.7 MILLION TRUMP VOTES NATIONWIDE. DATA ANALYSIS FINDS 221,000 PENNSYLVANIA VOTES SWITCHED FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BIDEN. 941,000 TRUMP VOTES DELETED. STATES USING DOMINION VOTING SYSTEMS SWITCHED 435,000 VOTES FROM TRUMP TO BIDEN.<U+0094> @ChanelRion @OANN. .@FoxNews daytime ratings have completely collapsed. Weekend daytime even WORSE. Very sad to watch this happen, but they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose. The biggest difference between the 2016 Election, and 2020, was @FoxNews!. <U+0093>OK, I<U+0092>ve seen enough. What<U+0092>s going to happen to these guys (McCabe, Comey &amp; the gang of treasonous thugs)? @SenJohnKennedy @MariaBartiromo @TheJusticeDept They, and many others, got caught. DO SOMETHING!!!. From 200,000 votes to less than 10,000 votes. If we can audit the total votes cast, we will easily win Arizona also! https://t.co/3eZHjdZL98. It took long enough! What is taking North Carolina so long? Are they looking for more ballots to fix that one also? Now with a recount, we will win Georgia also. Pennsylvania &amp; Michigan wouldn<U+0092>t let our Poll Watchers &amp; Observers into counting rooms. Illegal! https://t.co/TVTVv4s5Lx. Nobody wants to report that Pennsylvania and Michigan didn<U+0092>t allow our Poll Watchers and/or Vote Observers to Watch or Observe. This is responsible for hundreds of thousands of votes that should not be allowed to count. Therefore, I easily win both states. Report the News!. I am pleased to announce that I have given my full support and endorsement to Ronna McDaniel to continue heading the Republican National Committee (RNC). With 72 MILLION votes, we received more votes than any sitting President in U.S. history - and we will win!. Everyone is asking why the recent presidential polls were so inaccurate when it came to me. Because they are FAKE, just like much of the Lamestream Media!. A guy named Al Schmidt, a Philadelphia Commissioner and so-called Republican (RINO), is being used big time by the Fake  News Media to explain how honest things were with respect to the Election in Philadelphia. He refuses to look at a mountain of corruption &amp; dishonesty. We win!. Richard Hopkins, Pennsylvania postal worker, recants ballot-tampering claim - Washington Times https://t.co/C7isLvQ9QU  Stays with the truth, his original story.. The Fake Pollsters at @ABC/@washingtonpost produced a possibly illegal suppression Poll just before the Election showing me down 17 points in Wisconsin when, in fact, on Election Day, the race was even - &amp; we are now preparing to win the state. Many such <U+0093>deplorable<U+0094> instances!. I Was In Philadelphia Watching Fraud Happen. Here<U+0092>s How It Went Down https://t.co/fRMw3ilbYG They shut out our Poll Watchers and Observers. Those hundreds of thousands of votes should not be allowed. Corrupt politics.. Andrew McCabe was exposed for who he is today in the U.S. Senate. He was totally destroyed - an ignorant fool. The great people of the FBI must make sure that he and his former boss, James Comey, pay the price for what they have done to the reputation of the FBI.. <U+0093>I don<U+0092>t care what state you<U+0092>re in, this computer voting system is wide open to fraud and intervention.<U+0094> @LouDobbs  True, and wait until you see what<U+0092>s coming!. Pennsylvania Party Leadership votes are this week. I hope they pick very tough and smart fighters. We will WIN!!. Nate Simington, a very smart and qualified individual, is having his Senate hearing today. Republicans will hopefully confirm him to the FCC ASAP! We need action NOW on this very important nomination!! @SenatorWicker @MarshaBlackburn @senatemajldr. Republicans, don<U+0092>t let Andrew McCabe continue to get away with totally criminal activity. What he did should never be allowed to happen to our Country again. FIGHT FOR JUSTICE!. Highly Respected Ken Starr: <U+0093>Pennsylvania<U+0092>s three-day extension of the mail-in ballot deadline is a Constitutional Travesty.<U+0094> Legal scholars agree!. <U+0093>Only because of President Trump, we are going to have a Vaccine by the end of the year.<U+0094>  Ronny Jackson, Texas Congressman-Elect. <U+0093>President Trump told us for some time we would be getting a Vaccine by the end of the year and people laughed at him, and here we are with Pfizer getting FDA approval by the end of this month. He was right.<U+0094> @MariaBartiromo. Nolte: Bret Baier Deletes Tweet that Exposed Backlash Against Fox News https://t.co/k98LQLPwsK via @BreitbartNews. The @US_FDA and the Democrats didn<U+0092>t want to have me get a Vaccine WIN, prior to the election, so instead it came out five days later <U+0096> As I<U+0092>ve said all along!. If Joe Biden were President, you wouldn<U+0092>t have the Vaccine for another four years, nor would the @US_FDA have ever approved it so quickly. The bureaucracy would have destroyed millions of lives!. As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn<U+0092>t have the courage to do it before. Likewise, the @US_FDA should have announced it earlier, not for political purposes, but for saving lives!. ...The worst polling ever, and then they<U+0092>ll be back in four years to do it again. This is much more then voter and campaign finance suppression!. ...ABC/WaPo had me down 17 points in Wisconsin, the day before the election, and I WON! In Iowa, the polls had us 4 points down, and I won by 8.2%! Fox News and Quinnipiac were wrong on everything.... .@FoxNews, @QuinnipiacPoll, ABC/WaPo, NBC/WSJ were so inaccurate with their polls on me, that it really is tampering with an Election. They were so far off in their polling, and in their attempt to suppress - that they should be called out for Election Interference.... Pennsylvania prevented us from watching much of the Ballot count. Unthinkable and illegal in this country.. Wisconsin is looking very good. Needs a little time statutorily. Will happen soon! @Reince @SeanDuffyWI. Nevada is turning out to be a cesspool of Fake Votes. @mschlapp &amp; @AdamLaxalt are finding things that, when released, will be absolutely shocking!. The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated. A very large number of Ballots are impacted. Stay tuned!. ...Chris will do a GREAT job! Mark Esper has been terminated. I would like to thank him for his service.. I am pleased to announce that Christopher C. Miller, the highly respected Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (unanimously confirmed by the Senate), will be Acting Secretary of Defense, effective immediately... Investigators Dispatched After Fulton County Discovers <U+0091>Issue<U+0091> with Ballot Reporting https://t.co/lShmKksQ0O via @BreitbartNews. Since when does the Lamestream Media call who our next president will be? We have all learned a lot in the last two weeks!. <U+0093>We believe these people are thieves. The big city machines are corrupt. This was a stolen election. Best pollster in Britain wrote this morning that this clearly was a stolen election, that it<U+0092>s impossible to imagine that Biden outran Obama in some of these states.. ....how these ballots were authenticated, because if there<U+0092>s a problem in the system about authentication, that would seriously affect the ENTIRE ELECTION - And what concerns me is that we had over a hundred million mail-in ballot in cites like Philladelphia.... ....Supreme Court Justice to compel them to separate ballots that were received after the legislative deadline. It required the intervention of Justice Alito. That<U+0092>s a large group of ballots. When you talk about systemic problems, it<U+0092>s about.... <U+0093>We should look at the votes. We<U+0092>re just beginning the tabulation stage. We should look at these allegations. We<U+0092>re seeing a number of affidavits that there has been voter fraud. We have a history in this country of election problems. In Pennsylvania you had an order by a.... THE OBSERVERS WERE NOT ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. I WON THE ELECTION, GOT 71,000,000 LEGAL VOTES. BAD THINGS HAPPENED WHICH OUR OBSERVERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE. NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

People were screaming STOP THE COUNT &amp; WE DEMAND TRANSPARENCY (As Legal Observers were refused admittance to count rooms)! https://t.co/CW1tivI45c. ....Bad things took place during those hours where LEGAL TRANSPARENCY was viciously &amp; crudely not allowed. Tractors blocked doors &amp; windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms. BAD THINGS HAPPENED INSIDE. BIG CHANGES TOOK PLACE!. ....This would ALSO change the Election result in numerous States, including Pennsylvania, which everyone thought was easily won on Election Night, only to see a massive lead disappear, without anyone being allowed to OBSERVE, for long intervals of time, what the happened.... Tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 P.M. on Tuesday, Election Day, totally and easily changing the results in Pennsylvania and certain other razor thin states. As a separate matter, hundreds of thousands of Votes were illegally not allowed to be OBSERVED.... <U+0093>We need an explanation as to how these numbers have been running up for the last two or three days.<U+0094> Matthew Whitaker. @EveningEdit. I had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by. Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!. Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President. I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!. With the attack by the Radical Left Dems on the Republican Senate, the Presidency becomes even more important!. ....has been able to render decisions in a matter of days.<U+0094> Ken Starr, former Independent Counsel @Varneyco. ....hopefully this will be corrected at the Supreme Court of the United States. Also, these late ballots past Election Day are illegal, exactly what the President has been saying. The Supreme Court, in extraordinary circumstances,.... ....Legislature. They just ignored that, ignored the Constitution. Now we bring it down to the counting houses, and outrageously, observers, who are the sentinels of integrity &amp; transparency, were excluded. Pennsylvania has conducted itself in a horrible lawless way, and..... <U+0093>This is what we know. We have to go back to the state level and how this morass came to be in the first instance. The Governor, Wolf, and the State Supreme Court, flagrantly violated the Constitution of the U.S. The power to set these rules and regulations is vested in the. I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST. The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes accepted during this period must be determined to be ILLEGAL VOTES. U.S. Supreme Court should decide!. So now the Democrats are working to gain control of the U.S. Senate through their actions on John James, David Perdue, and more. Would End the Filibuster, <U+0093>Life<U+0094>, 2A, and would Pack and Rotate the Court. Presidency becomes even more important. We will win!. All of the recent Biden claimed States will be legally challenged by us for Voter Fraud and State Election Fraud. Plenty of proof - just check out the Media. WE WILL WIN! America First!.

Detroit Absentee Ballot Counting Chaos, Blocked Windows and Observers https://t.co/KzIwhbQrDt via @BreitbartNews. Our lawyers have asked for <U+0093>meaningful access<U+0094>, but what good does that do? The damage has already been done to the integrity of our system, and to the Presidential Election itself. This is what should be discussed!. We have claimed, for Electoral Vote purposes, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (which won<U+0092>t allow legal observers) the State of Georgia, and the State of North Carolina, each one of which has a BIG Trump lead. Additionally, we hereby claim the State of Michigan if, in fact,...... We are winning Pennsylvania big, but the PA Secretary of State just announced that there are <U+0093>Millions of ballots left to be counted.<U+0094>. Wow! It looks like Michigan has now found the ballots necessary to keep a wonderful young man, John James, out of the U.S. Senate. What a terrible thing is happening!. They are working hard to make up 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania disappear <U+0097> ASAP. Likewise, Michigan and others!. They are finding Biden votes all over the place <U+0097> in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. So bad for our Country!. How come every time they count Mail-In ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?. Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run &amp; controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the <U+0093>pollsters<U+0094> got it completely &amp; historically wrong!. We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!. Get out &amp; VOTE! Under my Administration, our ECONOMY is growing at the fastest rate EVER at 33.1%. Next year will be the GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR in American History!

He has also vowed to terminate our national security travel bans, allowing for unlimited migration from war zones, and terrorist havens....

The @nytimes now admits that patients ill with Covid are getting better faster and at higher (much) percentages.. More Testing equals more Cases. We have best testing. Deaths WAY DOWN. Hospitals have great additional capacity! Doing much better than Europe. Therapeutics working!. If Sleepy Joe Biden is actually elected President, the 4 Justices (plus1) that helped make such a ridiculous win possible would be relegated to sitting on not only a heavily PACKED COURT, but probably a REVOLVING COURT as well.

He then scammed @CNN, lied to @andersoncooper, &amp; got a job there..... Our hearts are with the people of France. America stands with our oldest Ally in this fight. These Radical Islamic terrorist attacks must stop immediately. No country, France or otherwise can long put up with it!. GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close. Next year will be FANTASTIC!!! However, Sleepy Joe Biden and his proposed record setting tax increase, would kill it all.

So much has been learned in the last two weeks about how corrupt our Media is, and now Big Tech, maybe even worse. Repeal Section 230!. It<U+0092>s amazing. Twitter refuses to allow the any mention of the Biden corruption story which was carried so well on @TuckerCarlson last night. It<U+0092>s the biggest story and Big Tech, together with the Lamestream Media, isn<U+0092>t allowing a word to be said about it.. Incredible evening, incredible people. Love Nebraska, and there were plenty of great people from Iowa there also! $28 Billion for Farmers!!! https://t.co/S7tn3krGdz. Covid, Covid, Covid is the unified chant of the Fake News Lamestream Media. They will talk about nothing else until November 4th., when the Election will be (hopefully!) over. Then the talk will be how low the death rate is, plenty of hospital rooms, &amp; many tests of young people.. As a developer long ago, and continuing to this day, the politicians ran Chicago into the ground. I was able to make an appropriately great deal with the numerous lenders on a large and very beautiful tower. Doesn<U+0092>t that make me a smart guy rather than a bad guy?.

Also, I PREPAID many Millions of Dollars in Taxes.. They (his handlers) ripped Sleepy Joe off the stage yesterday when he got lost in a <U+0093>mental fog<U+0094>. A disaster. Very little reporting on this!. The biggest difference between now and 2016 is @FoxNews. They are a whole different deal. Despite this, our campaign is doing much better, with bigger crowds and even more (much!) enthusiasm, than we had in 2016. Big Debate &amp; SCOTUS Win! Real Polls have us winning everywhere!. Obama is drawing VERY small (tiny) numbers of people. Biden is drawing almost no one. We are drawing tens of thousands of people. You<U+0092>ll see that again today. The Great Red Wave is coming!!!. Death rate of people going into hospitals is MUCH LOWER now than it was. @MSNBC  Wow, MSDNC has come a long way! The fact is that we have learned and done a lot about this Virus. Much different now than when it first arrived on our shores, and the World<U+0092>s, from China!. Thank you very much to the great @WashTimes for the wonderful Endorsement of the job I have done as President. <U+0093>His record of achievement in his first term is unmatched by any president in modern times. A second term is likely to bring more successes and a stronger America.<U+0094>. Big GDP projected. Pelosi only looking to Bail Out badly run Democrat Cities. Tap, Tap, Taping us along. She has little interest in helping out the <U+0093>people<U+0094>.. Until November 4th., Fake News Media is going full on Covid, Covid, Covid. We are rounding the turn. 99.9%..

Most important Election of your life!. Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd..

I have plenty to say about the dishonesty of the Media and Sleepy Joe. A terrible coverup is happening in our Country!!!. We have made tremendous progress with the China Virus, but the Fake News refuses to talk about it this close to the Election. COVID, COVID, COVID is being used by them, in total coordination, in order to change our great early election numbers.Should be an election law violation!. Joe Biden called me George yesterday. Couldn<U+0092>t remember my name. Got some help from the anchor to get him through the interview. The Fake News Cartel is working overtime to cover it up!. <U+0093>A Pennsylvania Appeals Court turns down the Trump Administrations request for Poll Watchers to monitor satellite election offices.<U+0094> @OANN  How terrible is this?

Pennsylvania Ballot <U+0093>mistakes<U+0094> made, in my opinion, on purpose by the Democrat Governor, puts Republicans, in particular @SeanParnellUSA, at great risk. Corrupt politics in Pennsylvania must be investigated immediately. By the way, Philadelphia is out of control. @TheJusticeDept. So important to VOTE for Republicans in the House. Break away from Pelosi and her high Taxing new Radical Left friends. Protect your 2nd Amendment, Military, Vets, and sooo much more!. .@SeanParnellUSA is a bright star for Pennsylvania. Military, Vets, Low Taxes and your 2nd Amendment will be totally protected. His opponent is a weak and ineffective puppet for Pelosi and her new Radical Left friends. Vote for Sean Parnell!.

It was pathetic, those involved have said. Joe didn<U+0092>t have a clue!. Biden said he is going to <U+0093>transition out of (fracking) by 2025<U+0094>. I hope Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and all of the rest were listening last night. High energy prices, massive jobs losses! Vote Trump.. Joe Biden was very disrespectful to President Obama at last night<U+0092>s debate when he said that he, Joe, <U+0093>was Vice President, not President,<U+0094> when trying to make excuses for their failed immigration policies. I wonder what <U+0093>O<U+0094> was thinking when he heard that one?. Today is the LAST DAY to register to VOTE in-person, in the Great State of Nebraska! Get<U+00A0>everything you need to cast your vote and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, below! https://t.co/WwzdPhDkAZ. HUGE win today for the United States and for peace in the world.

More will follow! https://t.co/UHB8H6oaZc. Just signed an order to support the workers of Delphi Corporation and make sure that we protect the pensions of all American workers! Obama-Biden FAILED American workers and FAILED the workers of Delphi. I ALWAYS put American workers FIRST!. Wow. Today<U+0092>s @nypost story on Joe Biden<U+0092>s corruption is a monster. Many witnesses to a crime against our Country. This isn<U+0092>t going away. Even the Lamestream Media is starting to say it must be covered!. Biden wants to Pack the Court with Radical Left crazies. He doesn<U+0092>t even want to make a list to explain who they are. Can<U+0092>t let this happen!. Finally! Suburban women are flocking over to us. They realize that I am saving the Suburbs - the American Dream! I terminated the Regulation that would bring projects and crime to Suburbia. Not on my watch! Biden will bring the Regulation back, but bigger and worse.. Obama is campaigning for us. Every time he speaks, people come over to our side. He didn<U+0092>t even want to endorse Sleepy Joe. Did so long after primaries were over!. Look at the bias, hatred and rudeness on behalf of 60 Minutes and CBS. Tonight<U+0092>s anchor, Kristen Welker, is far worse! #MAGA

Andrew spends too much time listening to his brother, Fredo. Forget the books and your apology tour. The Federal Government would love to help New York regain its luster!. Governor Cuomo has shown tremendously poor leadership skills in running N.Y. Bad time for him to be writing and promoting a book, especially since he has done such a poor job with Covid and Crime. So many unnecessary deaths. The City &amp; State have sunk to historic lows.... ...P.S. Tony should stop wearing the Washington Nationals<U+0092> Mask for two reasons. Number one, it is not up to the high standards that he should be exposing. Number two, it keeps reminding me that Tony threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!. Dr.Tony Fauci says we don<U+0092>t allow him to do television, and yet I saw him last night on @60Minutes, and he seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope.

New government of Sudan, which is making great progress, agreed to pay $335 MILLION to U.S. terror victims and families. Once deposited, I will lift Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. At long last, JUSTICE for the American people and BIG step for Sudan!. ....There has never been more enthusiasm or spirit, by everyone. Great fun, and so good for our Country.

Very proud of the @nypost, my former <U+0093>hometown newspaper<U+0094>. They have said and shown what everyone knows about Sleepy Joe Biden. He is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN!!!. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, and everybody knows it. Now you have the proof, perhaps like never was had before on a major politician. Laptop plus. This is the second biggest political scandal in our history!. Hunter Biden<U+0092>s laptop is a disaster for the entire Biden family, but especially for his father, Joe. It is now a proven fact, and cannot be denied, that all of that info is the REAL DEAL. That makes it impossible for <U+0093>50%, or 10%<U+0094> Joe, to ever assume the office of the President!. The United States shows more CASES than other countries, which the Lamestream Fake News Media pounces on daily, because it TESTS at such a high (and costly) level. No country in the world tests at this level. The more you TEST, the more CASES you will be reporting. Very simple!. ...while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician <U+0097> and the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. This makes Crooked Hillary Clinton look like amateur hour!. Joe Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt political class that enriched itself while draining the economic life and soul from our Country. For the last 47 years, Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders, and ravaged our cities.... This election is a choice between a TRUMP RECOVERY and a BIDEN DEPRESSION.

CAN ANYBODY REALLY VOTE FOR THIS?. ....practically nothing. Both Senators became totally unelectable, couldn<U+0092>t come even close to winning their primaries, and decided to drop out of politics and gracefully <U+0093>RETIRE<U+0094>. @SenSasse could be next, or perhaps the Republicans should find a new and more viable candidate?. Senator Little Ben Sasse of the Great State of Nebraska seems to be heading down the same inglorious path as former Senators Liddle<U+0092> Bob Corker, whose approval rating in Tennessee went from 55% to 4%, &amp; Jeff <U+0093>the Flake<U+0094> Flake, whose approval rating in Arizona went from 56% to..... ...Nomination to run for a second term. Then he went back to his rather stupid and obnoxious ways. Must feel he can<U+0092>t lose to a Dem. Little Ben is a liability to the Republican Party, and an embarrassment to the Great State of Nebraska. Other than that, he<U+0092>s just a wonderful guy!. The least effective of our 53 Republican Senators, and a person who truly doesn<U+0092>t have what it takes to be great, is Little Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a State which I have gladly done so much to help. @SenSasse was as nice as a RINO can be until he recently won the Republican..... Trump in Georgia: <U+0091>Nobody Has Done More for the Black Community<U+0091> https://t.co/CPH68LRFcg via @BreitbartNews. Biden made another big mistake. He totally mixed up two Crime Bills. Didn<U+0092>t have a clue (as usual!). Also, he freely used the term SUPER PREDATOR!!!. There is a nasty rumor out there that @SenatorCollins of Maine will not be supporting our great United States Supreme Court Nominee. Well, she didn<U+0092>t support Healthcare or my opening up 5000 square miles of Ocean to Maine, so why should this be any different. Not worth the work!. Big T was not a reference to me, but rather to Big Tech, which should have been properly pointed out in Twitter<U+0092>s Fake Trending Section!. Steve Scully of @cspan had a very bad week. When his name was announced, I said he would not be appropriate because of conflicts. I was right! Then he said he was hacked, he wasn<U+0092>t. I was right again! But his biggest mistake was <U+0093>confiding<U+0094> in a lowlife loser like the Mooch. Sad!. Sleepy Joe Biden had a very bad showing last night, despite the fact that @GStephanopoulos didn<U+0092>t ask him any questions on his being a <U+0093>corrupt politician<U+0094>. Big Tech &amp; Lamestream Media are working hard to hide this corruption!!!. Ammar is a puppet for Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left.

I will be doing a major Fake @NBCNews Town Hall Forum, live tonight from Miami, at 8:00 P.M. They asked me to do it in place of the Rigged Steve Scully (he is now suspended from @cspan for lying) Debate. I wonder if they<U+0092>ll treat me as well as Sleepy Joe? They should!. I was right again! Steve Scully just admitted he was lying about his Twitter being hacked. The Debate was Rigged! He was suspended from @cspan indefinitely. The Trump Campaign was not treated fairly by the <U+0093>Commission<U+0094>. Did I show good instincts in being the first to know?. If we don<U+0092>t win, the Radical Left will destroy our Country. Biden refuses to answer questions on packing the SCOTUS! Dems will pack the Court w/ radical left justices who will shred the #2A, empower violent mobs, and protect terrorists &amp; violent criminals! https://t.co/qUrjRM6MTp.

Joe also said yesterday he<U+0092>s running for the U.S. Senate (again) and totally forgot where he was (wrong State!). Joe has never been a nice or kind guy, so it<U+0092>s easier to find this obvious &amp; rapidly getting worse <U+0093>dementia<U+0094> unacceptable for USA! https://t.co/QIpH7RDfAV. ....Much of the money we have spent is on our ground game, said to be the best ever put together. I<U+0092>ll let you know how good it is on November 3rd. Very expensive to do, but opportunity could be BIG! I will spend additional money if we are not spending enough!. I keep reading Fake News stories that my campaign is running low on money. Not true, &amp; if it were so, I would put up money myself. The fact is that we have much more money than we had 4 years ago, where we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary, and still easily won, 306-223!. Great Florida Rally tonight. Big crowd, lot of enthusiasm (you win races with enthusiasm). Just got back. Tomorrow night it<U+0092>s off to Pennsylvania and another BIG crowd. We are winning. Economy is starting to boom.

Now, he is pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee...
https://t.co/ON0iRBfFS2. Biden refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. He says voters <U+0093>don<U+0092>t deserve<U+0094> to know. If they win, Dems will pack the #SCOTUS w/ radical left justices who will shred the #2A, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals &amp; terrorists. https://t.co/alVSZUDc73. Joe Biden<U+0092>s agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida Seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare.

It<U+0092>s only going to get worse. It is not sustainable for our County - China will own us!!!!. Biden losing big in Florida. Only Fake Polls show otherwise! Bad for Healthcare. Thinks he<U+0092>s running for the Senate. Forgot Mitt Romney<U+0092>s name, and where he was!. The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!. Republicans should be strongly focused on completing a wonderful stimulus package for the American People!. Sleepy Joe Biden had a particularly bad day today. He couldn<U+0092>t remember the name of Mitt Romney, said again he was running for the U.S. Senate, and forgot what State he was in. If I did any of this, it would be disqualifying. With him, he<U+0092>s just Sleepy Joe!. He should sue the women, and all of those who illegally worked with them, for false and disgusting accusations!!! https://t.co/ocdEeIFxeF.

So Biden is coughing and hacking and playing <U+0093>fingers<U+0094> with his mask, all over the place, and the Fake News doesn<U+0092>t want to even think about discussing it. <U+0093>Journalism<U+0094> has reached the all time low in history. Sadly, Lamestream knows this and doesn<U+0092>t even care!. Almost nobody showed up to the Sleepy Joe Biden <U+0093>Rally<U+0094> in Ohio. The reporting and polls are a Media Con Job - Fake News. We have far more support and enthusiasm than even in 2016. November 3rd. will be a great day for America!!!  #MAGA. STOCK MARKET UP ANOTHER 300 POINTS - GREATEST LEADING INDICATOR OF THEM ALL!!!

Remember all of this when you VOTE. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your Taxes. Depression!!! Don<U+0092>t let it happen! #MAGA. Republicans must state loudly and clearly that WE are going to provide much better Healthcare at a much lower cost. Get the word out! Will always protect pre-existing conditions!!!. We will have Healthcare which is FAR BETTER than ObamaCare, at a FAR LOWER COST - BIG PREMIUM REDUCTION. PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE PROTECTED AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL THAN NOW. HIGHLY UNPOPULAR AND UNFAIR INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ALREADY TERMINATED. YOU<U+0092>RE WELCOME!. So Crazy to watch Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut lecture all on morals &amp; ethics when for 25 years he said he was a Great War Hero in Vietnam, and he was never even there. He lied &amp; cheated right up until the day he got caught. Thank you to those in military who turned him in!. Remember, I wouldn<U+0092>t be President now had Obama and Biden properly done their job. The fact is, they were TERRIBLE!!!. November 3rd. will be the most exciting day in U.S. Election History, even more so than 2016. Tremendous excitement and enthusiasm, like perhaps never seen before. Nobody showing up to Sleepy Joe Rallies. Places are DEAD. Stiff!!! See you in Florida tonight.. Maxine Waters has long been considered <U+0093>the most corrupt person in Congress<U+0094>.

Our Country cannot survive as a Socialist Nation, and that<U+0092>s what the Democrats want it to be. The USA will never become a large scale version of Venezuela. All control is already being taken away from Sleepy Joe. He has Zero to say!!!. The Republicans are giving the Democrats a great deal of time, which is not mandated, to make their self serving statements relative to our great new future Supreme Court Justice. Personally, I would pull back, approve, and go for STIMULUS for the people!!!. Remember, Stock Market at an All Time High, and going up. 401k<U+0092>s at RECORD. With Sleepy Joe comes Tax Increases, jobs losses and DEPRESSION like never seen before!!! VOTE!!!. SO MUCH FAKE NEWS!

VOTE!!!. See you in Sanford, Florida, tonight for a Big Rally. Covered Live on @OANN, @newsmax and @cspan. Enjoy!!!. The FBI and Law Enforcement must focus their energy on ANTIFA and the Radical Left, those who have spent the summer trying to burn down poorly run Democrat Cities throughout the USA!. Big spike in the China Plague in Europe and other places that the Fake News used to hold up as examples of places that are doing well, in order to make the U.S look bad. Be strong and vigilant, it will run its course. Vaccines and cures are coming fast!. Put these animals in jail, now. The Radical Left only knows how to take advantage of very dumb <U+0093>leadership<U+0094> fools. This is Biden! Law &amp; Order! https://t.co/w0yH3SqnrB.

They are indeed Dr. Fauci<U+0092>s own words. We have done a <U+0093>phenomenal<U+0094> job, according to certain governors.

St. Louis, Oakland, Baltimore, and so many other places,  were a complete &amp; total disaster. I wouldn<U+0092>t be in the beautiful White House if it weren<U+0092>t for Sleepy Joe, etc.. A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday. That means I can<U+0092>t get it (immune), and can<U+0092>t give it. Very nice to know!!!. In 2016, the ABC News/Washington Post Poll was such a complete disaster that these two Fake News Organizations changed the numbers prior to the Election.

Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist<U+0097>while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities.... Governor Whitmer of Michigan has done a terrible job. She locked down her state for everyone, except her husband<U+0092>s boating activities. The Federal Government provided tremendous help to the Great People of Michigan. My Justice Department and Federal Law Enforcement announced....

Biden and Democrats just clarified the fact that they are fully in favor of (very) LATE TERM ABORTION, right up until the time of birth, and beyond - which would be execution. Biden even endorsed the Governor of Virginia, who stated this clearly for all to hear. GET OUT &amp; VOTE!!!. Wow. Joe Biden just took a more Liberal position on Roe v.

Why would I allow the Debate Commission to change the rules for the second and third Debates when I easily won last time?. 100,000 DEFECTIVE BALLOTS IN NEW YORK. THEY WANT TO REPLACE THEM, BUT WHERE, AND WHAT HAPPENS TO, THE BALLOTS THAT WERE FIRST SENT? THEY WILL BE USED BY SOMEBODY. USA, END THIS SCAM - GO OUT AND VOTE!. In just 3 and a half years, we have secured America<U+0092>s Borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S. Military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate, fixed our disastrous Trade Deals, and brought JOBS back home to America <U+0096> and back to MINNESOTA! #MAGA https://t.co/nX2oU5IWL0. As VP, Biden wiped out the Iron Range <U+0096> seven plants were idled and more than 2K workers were laid off. After I put Tariffs on foreign steel, the Iron Range came roaring back to life! If Joe gets in, the Radical Left will shut down the Iron Range FOREVER! https://t.co/2Gk2uOjaCW. I want to defend &amp; preserve our nation<U+0092>s historic values. Our opponents stand with rioters <U+0096> I stand with the heroes of Law Enforcement. Biden says Antifa is just an idea. Ideas don<U+0092>t assault cops &amp; burn down buildings. Antifa is a domestic terrorist org. https://t.co/ZSnRJ8DaQo. Comey is a disaster who cheated and lied. How do you write books when you can<U+0092>t remember anything? Should be tried for treason. This is ridiculous! https://t.co/Xc6OiM4dcJ. Last night I did what the corrupt media has refused to do: I held Joe Biden Accountable for his 47 years of lies, 47 years of betrayals, and 47 years of failure. The whole nation saw the truth <U+0097> Joe Biden is too weak to lead this Country! https://t.co/8WepHOC0XN. So when will something significant happen to James Comey? Got caught cold. He is either very dumb, or one of the worst liars in political history. TOO LONG. EMBARRASSING!. Leaving Minneapolis for a quick stop in Duluth to celebrate the opening of the Obama CLOSED Iron Range. My great honor!!!. Just landed in Minnesota. Hasn<U+0092>t been won by a Republican since 1972, and we saved Minneapolis. Also opened the massive and beautiful Iron Range, which Obama and Sleepy Joe closed.  Thousands of jobs started back. They will close again. How can we lose?. HIGHEST CABLE TELEVISION RATINGS OF ALL TIME. SECOND HIGHEST OVERALL TELEVISION RATINGS OF ALL TIME. Some day these Fake Media Companies are going to miss me, very badly!!!. So weird to watch @FoxNews interviewing only failed Dems, like Represenative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who got zero percent in his recent presidential run, and following Sleepy Joe<U+0092>s train to wherever. What a difference from the past - But we will win anyway!!!. Many more people would have died from the China Virus if Sleepy Joe were your President. He didn<U+0092>t even want me to close our Country to Infected China until TWO MONTHS  later, when he said I was right. Now he likes to say I didn<U+0092>t close up <U+0093>fast enough<U+0094>. Just another politician!. Heading to Minnesota today. Saved Minneapolis after the Dem LEFT almost let it be TOTALLY destroyed! #MAGA. Wow! 100,000 Mail In Ballots in New York City a total MESS. Mayor and Governor have no idea what to do. Big Fraud, Unfixable! Cancel Ballots and go out and VOTE, just like in past decades, when there were no problems!. Biden wants to Pack the Supreme Court, thereby ruining it. Also, he wants no fracking, killing our Energy business, and JOBS. Second Amendment is DEAD if Biden gets in! Is that what you want from a leader? He will destroy our Country! VOTE NOW USA.. Nobody wants Sleepy Joe as a leader, including the Radical Left (which he lost last night!). He disrespected Bernie, effectively calling him a loser!. Chris had a tough night. Two on one was not surprising, but  fun. Many important points made, like throwing Bernie, AOC PLUS 3, and the rest, to the wolves! Radical Left is dumping Sleepy Joe. Zero Democrat enthusiasm, WEAK Leadership! https://t.co/BGbPVHau3M.

Our Great 1st Amendment, our Great 2nd Amendment, our right to worship God &amp; so much more comes down to one vote on the Court. @TedCruz has a fantastic new book, <U+0093>One Vote Away<U+0094>, out today!

Now Fake News @CNN is actually reporting that I wanted my daughter, Ivanka, to run with me as my Vice President in 2016 Election. Wrong and totally ridiculous. These people are sick!. .....Financial Statements, from  the time I announced I was going to run for President,  showing all properties, assets and debts. It is a very IMPRESSIVE Statement, and also shows that I am the only President on record to give up my yearly $400,000 plus Presidential Salary!. .....Also, if you look at the extraordinary assets owned by me, which the Fake News hasn<U+0092>t, I am extremely under leveraged - I have very little debt compared to the value of assets. Much of this information is already on file, but I have long said that I may release..... The Fake News Media, just like Election time 2016, is bringing up my Taxes &amp; all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information &amp; only bad intent. I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation &amp; tax credits...... The Ballots being returned to States cannot be accurately counted. Many things are already going very wrong!. This is totally illegal. Hope that the U.S. Attorney in Minnesota has this, and other of her many misdeeds, under serious review??? If not, why not??? We will win Minnesota because of her, and law enforcement. Saved Minneapolis &amp; Iron O Range! https://t.co/yete31P680. Obamacare will be replaced with a MUCH better, and FAR cheaper, alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court. Would be a big WIN for the USA!. Wow, nobody realized how far Mini Mike Bloomberg went in bribing ex-prisoners to go out and vote for Sleepy Joe. He is desperate to get back into the good graces of the people who not only badly beat him, but made him look like a total fool. Now he<U+0092>s committed a serious crime!. Hanoi Dick, who lied for years by saying he was a war hero in Vietnam, and was never even there (Impeach him!), should not be entitled to a vote on anything of importance! https://t.co/QC2zv4IhYJ. I will be strongly demanding a Drug Test of Sleepy Joe Biden prior to, or after, the Debate on Tuesday night. Naturally, I will agree to take one also.

Thanks to the strong leadership of President @realDonaldTrump and the efforts of our Administration over the last year, Speaker Pelosi and Congressional Democrats have finally acquiesced to the voice of the American people have agreed to allow a vote on the #USMCA in the House.. Looking like very good Democrat support for USMCA. That would be great for our Country!. America<U+0092>s great USMCA Trade Bill is looking good. It will be the best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA. Good for everybody - Farmers, Manufacturers, Energy, Unions - tremendous support. Importantly, we will finally end our Country<U+0092>s worst Trade Deal, NAFTA!.

It<U+0092>s time for Democrats in Congress to put the American people FIRST and get to work!. This month alone our Administration has honored those serving in the Military, traveled across the country fighting for the #USMCA, opened a major Apple manufacturing plant in the USA, announced 2 historic rules to make healthcare prices more transparent &amp; much more!. As the #USMCA collects dust on Speaker Pelosi<U+0092>s desk and many other initiatives fall silent on the house floor, Democrats in Congress have proven once again that they care more about photo ops and political theater than working for the American people.. This week, President @realDonaldTrump is hard at work for our country at the #NATO70 Summit in London, while Speaker Pelosi and 14 Congressional Democrats are attending a climate conference in Madrid. https://t.co/P9EFRQVWGu.

Speaker Pelosi calls it the <U+0093>easiest trade deal<U+0094>, but a year later this bill<U+0097>which would benefit hardworking Americans<U+0097>sits in legislative purgatory. Enough partisan games<U+0097>let<U+0092>s pass #USMCAnow.. Today marks 365 days since @RealDonaldTrump signed the USMCA trade agreement.

See you soon WI! https://t.co/NnrPR1ZtE8. President @realDonaldTrump dedicated his entire @Cabinet meeting today to our nation<U+0092>s veterans. From passing the most sweeping reforms of the VA in over 50 years to a 19-year low veteran unemployment rate, we will always fight to give the best of America, America<U+0092>s best! <U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8> https://t.co/qAKG9IQEGw.

America will always admire his courage in turning Poland toward Democracy and helping to bring down the iron curtain. https://t.co/k9cki5oduy. Unemployment is near a 50-year low. Poverty rates are down. Inequality is down. Wages are up. Crime is falling.

And if House Democrats were as committed to helping Americans succeed under President @realDonaldTrump as they are to tearing him down, imagine where we could be.. We need a 2020 budget.

We need to pass USMCA to reform NAFTA.

House Democrats are effectively shutting down Congress for a single agenda item: endless investigations.

Nothing substantive can get done as long as the left is fixated on undoing the 2016 election, 3 years later.. The facts are with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. This charade has never been more than political theater and the American people know it. All they had to do was read the transcript.

Time to end these partisan #ImpeachingHearings and get back to the people<U+0092>s work.. What President @realDonaldTrump and our Administration care about: The American people
 
What Dems in Congress care about: A partisan impeachment sham

The United States stands with President @jguaido and all Venezuelans in their fight for #libertad. Venezuela deserves a safe, democratic and prosperous future. With no legitimate claim to power, Maduro must go. The oppressed people of Venezuela deserve to thrive again!. Our Administration<U+0092>s historic deregulation has rolled back the red tape that has burdened Americans and stifled economic growth. We look forward to continuing to protect Americans from overregulation through the Governors<U+0092> Initiative!. Great launch of the Governors<U+0092> Initiative on Regulatory Innovation this morning with @dougducey, @GovernorLittle, @GovStitt, and many governors from across the country. This initiative will help return power to the states.. We urge the Venezuelan military to stand with the people of Venezuela, not a despot. The Venezuelan military should be a force of good! The power to change for the better is in your hands!. Maduro and his gang of thugs continue to repress democracy. Yesterday<U+0092>s raid on President @jguaido<U+0092>s Party Headquarters is reprehensible and shows how weak and paranoid they are. Maduro has no respect for #libertad or the rule of law and he must go!. <U+0093>Army 1st Lt.

All 3 major U.S. stock markets hit record highs while House Democrats spent 7 hours arguing, on national TV, that the ""stated foreign policy"" of the United States is made by unelected bureaucrats and not the President.. Under the #USMCA, American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise, on top of the raise they<U+0092>ve already received at record levels under President @realDonaldTrump. The #USMCA is a win for working Americans!.

Game over. Time to end this impeachment charade. https://t.co/wZwdvwuRpI. Another week has passed and the result:
- President @realDonaldTrump and our Administration working on the issues important to the American people

This Congress has been held hostage by @RepAdamSchiff for far too long, I am ready to get back to work for my constituents.
This includes: 
<U+25AA><U+FE0F> Passing #USMCA
<U+25AA><U+FE0F> Lowering healthcare costs
<U+25AA><U+FE0F> Funding the gov't

The American people have had enough of this political charade.. Critical legislation is currently frozen in place. Casualties of Democrats<U+0092> apparent inability to make headway on anything besides fighting with the White House. 

We need action: 

<U+25B6><U+FE0F> National Defense
<U+25B6><U+FE0F> Funding the Gov't. 
<U+25B6><U+FE0F> USMCA https://t.co/Sdtxi4SPq9. THE FACTS:
1) The transcript is public<U+0097>it shows NO conditionality or quid pro quo
2) Presidents Trump and Zelensky have both confirmed<U+0097>NO pressure
3) Ukraine didn't know that aid was being withheld at the time of the call
4) The aid was released without any action from Ukraine. .@RepStefanik is right: ""For the millions of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following:

""Number 1: Ukraine received the aid.

""Number 2: There was, in fact, no investigation into Biden."" https://t.co/eZjrYbq6mz. An inconvenient fact for Democrats <U+21D2> The Trump Administration has significantly increased aid to Ukraine compared to the Obama Administration.

@RepBradWenstrup: ""Now we're providing Javelins which kill Russian tanks. MRE's and blankets do not do that."" https://t.co/qqfvnSwxWi. .@Jim_Jordan: You didn<U+0092>t listen in on President Trump &amp; Zelensky<U+0092>s call?

Jordan: You<U+0092>ve never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney?

Taylor: I never did.

Jordan: You<U+0092>ve never met the President?

Taylor: That<U+0092>s correct.

Jordan: And you<U+0092>re their star witness. https://t.co/ebZ6jsEjeB. After the call - Ambassador Taylor met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the VERY NEXT DAY!

President Zelensky said, <U+0093>The call was fine. I was happy with the call."" https://t.co/XujtOsQyge. John Ratcliffe making a great point: Adam Schiff just apparently changed the rules mid-hearing.

Virtually every question Democrats asked was leading, hearsay, or some other federal evidence rules violation. Now Schiff seems to be saying he can enforce those rules.

Unreal.. Four (4) Pinocchios.

That<U+0092>s what Adam Schiff earned for his claim that ""we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower."" https://t.co/zR8McgiyOD. This sham hearing is not only boring, it is a colossal waste of taxpayer time &amp; money. Congress should be working on passing USMCA, funding our govt &amp; military, working on reduced drug pricing &amp; so much more. @realDonaldTrump is working right now-the dems should follow his lead!. ""They're trying to stop me, because I'm fighting for you. And I'll never let that happen."" <U+0097> President @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ch0N1SWShe.

#KS02 #ksleg https://t.co/VQWwXVo7xL. Democrats insist they can <U+0093>walk and chew gum at the same time,<U+0094> but the proof is in the pudding. The #DoNothingDemocrats are absolutely consumed by their sham impeachment. Instead of ramping up this witch hunt, we should take action on issues the American people care about. https://t.co/qPMQinG4cR. .@DevinNunes: ""After vowing publicly that impeachment requires bipartisan support, Democrats are pushing impeachment forward without the backing of a single Republican."" #ImpeachmentHearings https://t.co/OSVboowMsm. Important initiatives are being pushed aside while the House continues to spend the rest of the legislative year set on undermining @realDonaldTrump with a tainted process.

It's been a month and my letter to @SpeakerPelosi urging to pass the #USMCAnow has still been ignored.. .@Jim_Jordan to Chairman Schiff: ""Of the 435 members of Congress, you are the only Member who knows who the whistleblower is, and your staff is the only staff who has had a chance to talk with that individual. 

""We would like that opportunity. When might that happen?"" https://t.co/UBzmorAbOR. Whether in Schiff<U+0092>s bunker or in open hearings, 4 facts will never change:

-The call transcript shows no linkage
-@POTUS and Zelensky both say no pressure
-Ukraine didn<U+0092>t know aid was held up at the time of the call
-Ukraine never took any action to get aid released. Reminder: the Chairman was caught misleading a reporter about communication with the whistleblower, barely four weeks ago https://t.co/qR6grFvXl5. Just minutes after President Trump took his oath of office on Inauguration Day 2017, the Washington Post ran a piece ushering in the beginning of his impeachment.

For the last 2 1/2 years Democrats spread baseless accusations of Russian collusion... then the Justice Department found NO collusion and NO obstruction.. Under POTUS @realDonaldtrump leadership, we<U+0092>ve rebuilt our military, our economy is booming &amp; overdose deaths from opioid abuse has declined 5% nationwide. We<U+0092>ve made great progress but we have much more work to do.... Yesterday, we were touting the USMCA, the largest trade deal in history that will create over 175k jobs. Today I met with troops preparing to deploy to the Middle East &amp; Afghanistan &amp; got an inspiring briefing at the first mental health hospital built in Indiana in 50 years... https://t.co/a6hzMrrGZw. It was great to be back in Indiana focusing on issues Americans care most about<U+0097>while Democrats in Congress are back trying to overturn the results of our election, President @realDonaldTrump &amp; I are focused on Jobs, National Security &amp; issues important to American Families.... The NeuroDiagnostic Institute is the first Indiana psychiatric hospital built in 50 years &amp; is a model for the Nation on addressing drug abuse, mental health &amp; public safety. As IN leads the way with overdose deaths down 12%, we will continue to fight for more places like NDI! https://t.co/RrkUZoV2Da. The amazing men and women of the Indiana National Guard at Camp Atterbury represent the best of America &amp; it was an honor to visit them today as they prepare for deployment. President @realDonaldTrump and I are with you and you will always have our support, prayers &amp; confidence! https://t.co/PiOc099OPN. It was my honor to sign my name on the <U+0093>Indiana Special Guitar<U+0094> next to so many remarkable Hoosiers at Southside Elementary today!

More than 2 million American manufacturing jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada<U+0097>including 61,000 Indiana jobs. Hoosiers and Americans across the country have a lot to gain from the #USMCA! https://t.co/ulNHNxktRZ. President @realDonaldTrump &amp; I promise that no matter what Democrats in Congress spend their time doing, we<U+0092>re going to stay focused on issues Americans care about: a strong national defense, secure borders, safe streets, upholding our Constitutional rights &amp; jobs, jobs, jobs! https://t.co/8XkOVMjkUP. President @realDonaldTrump and I will never stop fighting for you no matter what! You deserve to be put first and for the #USMCA trade deal to be passed! It<U+0092>s time for Congress to stop making reckless accusations against the President and get down to work. #USMCAnow https://t.co/ABd0kmmVXP. It was great to be at MacAllister Machinery today with @LGSuzanneCrouch, Linda McMahon and many more! Indiana and America need Congress to pass the largest and most comprehensive trade deal in American history, the #USMCA! https://t.co/xtHUlHGcXe. Hello Indiana!

More on today<U+0092>s $7 BILLION announcement: https://t.co/A68ueVC88u https://t.co/zdU9GohV78. Great day at the @WhiteHouse yesterday! Inspired by the courageous children from the Aflac Cancer Center and enjoyed meeting with tribal leaders and attending a faith-based community safety and security symposium. https://t.co/XRk7AmgUyu. <U+0093>Freedom works when we put America First.<U+0094>  Enjoy part 2 of my exclusive interview with @VP Mike Pence. #AmericaFirst #Dobbs https://t.co/vsMYR4y9AD. The transcript completely vindicates @realDonaldTrump in wake of Radical Dems<U+0092> efforts to undermine his presidency and overturn his election victory. Enjoy part 1 of my exclusive interview with @VP Mike Pence. #AmericaFirst #Dobbs https://t.co/nHwGSxbgIe. President @realDonaldTrump held a full slate of productive bilateral meetings with fellow member nations during #UNGA.

""Unfortunately, the press doesn't even cover it."" https://t.co/ROiawJz0Y7. Join Lou tonight for an exclusive interview with @VP at 7 PM ET. #AmericaFirst #MAGA #Dobbs https://t.co/cO9UfeS8ub. ...They can<U+0092>t run against this President<U+0092>s record...a record of accomplishment...so they decided to look for one more way to try to overturn the election and it<U+0092>s not going to work. The American people see through it!<U+0094> - VP Pence on @LouDobbs. <U+0093>63 million Americans voted for President @realDonaldTrump and put this administration in the @WhiteHouse and, from the day after the election, the Democrats have been trying to overturn the results of that election.... But different from the last Administration, under President @realDonaldTrump, we<U+0092>ve actually been providing defensive weapons. The Obama Administration was sending them blankets and pillows.<U+0094> <U+0096> VP Pence on @LouDobbs. <U+0093>The United States of America has stood strong with Ukraine ever since the Russian military overran Crimea and has been underwriting a savage war in the Donbas province in Ukraine.... <U+0085>and even though she knew the transcript was going to be released today, Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiates an impeachment inquiry into this Presidency and I think the American people have had enough.<U+0094> <U+0096> VP Pence on @LouDobbs. <U+0093>Last week Democrats were actually making baseless allegations against a Supreme Court Justice and calling for his impeachment. This week, before she had any of the facts<U+0085>. The ironic thing is that the only time it did happen that we know about is when former Vice President Joe Biden threatened over a billion dollars in aid to Ukraine in exchange for a specific act. In this case, the President has been completely vindicated.<U+0094> - VP Pence on @LouDobbs. As the President said a week ago, he did nothing wrong. The transcript reveals that despite reckless accusations in the media and by Democrats on Capitol Hill that the President threatened aid to Ukraine and demanded a specific act, it just never happened<U+0085>. In their bilateral meeting, President @realDonaldTrump and PM @AbeShinzo affirmed the close friendship and alliance between the United States and Japan.

They also signed the first stage of the trade agreement between our two great nations! https://t.co/GNpftGoqub.

Earlier this year, at the President's direction, @SecPompeo held the second annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, inviting more than a thousand civil society and religious leaders, from 100 different nations, to the largest event of its kind in the world.. The United States created the Genocide Recovery and Persecution Response Program, and we<U+0092>ve provided over $370 million in aid to ethnic minority and faith communities persecuted by ISIS in Iraq and throughout that region.. The threats to religious freedom and attacks on people of faith underscore why President @realDonaldTrump has taken such decisive action to build and promote our nation<U+0092>s proud tradition of advancing religious freedom.. Today, President Trump became the first President to convene a meeting on religious freedom at the UN. There<U+0092>s no better time for a meeting like this one on the world stage as more than 80% of the world<U+0092>s population live in nations where religious freedom is threatened or banned. https://t.co/lL1nUCqA2l. It was an honor to be with President @realDonaldTrump to reaffirm that every person is endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights and Americans have always believed our first freedom is the freedom of religion. https://t.co/MfbuegRnSv.

We stand with Guaido &amp; we call for democracy &amp; freedom to be restored in Venezuela..

Hardworking Americans like the men and women of Accumold in Iowa deserve a fair trade deal and the #USMCA is just that! https://t.co/NEPB1gtt6e.

How did the Apollo 11 crew navigate 238,900 miles to the moon without getting lost? Guided by the Apollo Guidance Computer, they confirmed their position by using a sextant. They trained with a star chart, showing locations, names &amp; code numbers for certain stars. #Apollo50th https://t.co/WP98UtHmRk. Giant leaps are not made by astronauts alone. #Apollo11 was successful thanks to the hard work of more than 400,000 people and the support of our country <U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8>. Now, learn about the teams that will take us back to the Moon: https://t.co/YfBycK40IE https://t.co/qaPK1XR5Qo.

Iranian FM Zarif<U+0092>s efforts to bolster Venezuelan Dictator Maduro will fail. The US will continue to stand strong for a free Venezuela and against the enemies of democracy. Maduro must go.. Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif's travel to Venezuela reminds us that Iran's destabilizing activities extend well beyond the Middle East. Hezbollah remains active in the Western Hemisphere and Iran<U+0092>s malign influence poses a threat to security and democracy in the region.. Maduro has brought nothing but misery to the people of Venezuela since he first took office. He is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and he MUST go. We<U+0092>re standing strong for a free and democratic Venezuela!. The United States will not stand idly by while Iranian-backed militias spread terror. Today I announced that the United States has placed sanctions on two leaders of these Iranian-backed militias.. 106 delegations gathered today at the @StateDept because we believe in the freedom of conscience and we will forever remain dedicated to the principle that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights<U+0097>that among them are life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness. https://t.co/6lEYioFzjD.

Grounded in our nation<U+0092>s founding principles, our Administration will always prioritize the protection of religious freedom!.

Our great @CBP agents deserve better and the American people deserve the whole story from CNN! https://t.co/hsKsU6umhW. Rather than broadcast the full story, showing the compassionate care the American people are providing to vulnerable families, tonight CNN only played video of men in the temporary facility and didn<U+0092>t play any footage of the family facility at all.... These men were in a temporary holding area because Democrats in Congress have refused to fund additional bed space.. The crisis at our southern border is not a <U+0093>manufactured crisis<U+0094>, it is real and is overwhelming our system. To show this, we also visited an overcrowded facility for adult men, many of whom have been arrested multiple times.. CNN is so dishonest. Today we took reporters to a detention facility on the border for families and children and all told us they were being treated well.. Thank you to the brave men and women of @CBP working tirelessly each day to secure our border. The work you do not only keeps our country safe but keeps the American people safe and we are so grateful for your service! https://t.co/aK4St41YFd.

The massive number of border crossings, particularly by families &amp; unaccompanied children, are overwhelming our Border Patrol agents and facilities, but we must treat people humanely.. Story after story comes in from the southern border about children being recycled, purchased &amp; used for profit by cartels &amp; smugglers. As Sen. Hawley said, the refusal of Congress to act to correct this humanitarian crisis is ""absolutely unbelievable and absolutely indefensible."" https://t.co/5Z8DRNCXhj.

I am also thankful for the frontline workers who are still confronting the virus around the clock.. Today's news of a second vaccine is further reason to feel hopeful. What was true with the first vaccine remains true with the second: we are still months away. Until then, Americans need to continue to practice social-distancing and mask-wearing to get the virus under control.. Congratulations to NASA and SpaceX on today's launch. It<U+0092>s a testament to the power of science and what we can accomplish by harnessing our innovation, ingenuity, and determination. I join all Americans and the people of Japan in wishing the astronauts Godspeed on their journey.. To the millions of Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists celebrating the Festival of Lights, @DrBiden and I send our best wishes for a #HappyDiwali. May your new year be filled with hope, happiness, and prosperity. Sal Mubarak.. I am the president-elect, but will not be president until next year. COVID-19 does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now. Urgent action is needed today, now, by the current administration.. I am alarmed by the surge in reported COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities. This crisis demands a robust and immediate federal response which has been woefully lacking.. As the remnants of Tropical Storm Eta continue to impact the east coast, I encourage everyone in its path to heed the warnings of emergency responders and local officials. Jill and I send our prayers to those facing yet another storm.. Today marks five years since the horrific ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris <U+0097> an assault not just on the people of France but against our common humanity.

As president, I will work to protect Americans and our allies, countering terrorism and extremist violence in all forms.. I extend my deep condolences to the loved ones of the peacekeepers, including 6 American service members, who died on Tiran Island, and wish a speedy recovery to the surviving American. I join all Americans in honoring their sacrifice, as I keep their loved ones in my prayers.. Because of the Affordable Care Act:

- People with pre-existing conditions are protected
- More than 20 million Americans gained coverage
- Nearly 12 million seniors have had their prescription drug costs reduced

Now more than ever, we have to protect and build on it. https://t.co/Vl5yliyUFm. Ron Klain<U+0092>s deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again. https://t.co/s4XlAgMrxf. This Veterans Day, I feel the full weight of the honor and the responsibility that has been entrusted to me by the American people as the next president, and I vow to honor our country<U+0092>s sacred obligation. https://t.co/BuynOGvSO0. Today, we honor the service of those who have worn the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States. 

To our proud veterans<U+0097>I will be a commander in chief who respects your sacrifice, understands your service, and will never betray the values you fought so bravely to defend.. We are going to build a health care system that puts you and your family first <U+0097> and that every American can be proud of.. If you<U+0092>re sick, if you<U+0092>re struggling, if you<U+0092>re worried about how you<U+0092>re going to get through the day <U+0097> we will not abandon you.

We will not leave you to face these challenges alone. https://t.co/eZUHaFE5bl. When I<U+0092>m speaking to foreign leaders, I<U+0092>m telling them: America is going to be back. We<U+0092>re going to be back in the game.. Come January, we will work quickly with Congress to dramatically ramp up health care protections, get America to universal coverage, and lower health care costs.. Beginning on January 20th, Vice President-elect Harris and I are going to do everything in our power to ease the burden of health care on you and your families.. Today, the Trump Administration is in court, attempting to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. Tune in as I discuss how my administration will expand access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/JB5uwBTKnd. .@KamalaHarris and I aren<U+0092>t wasting any time. We<U+0092>re ready to get COVID-19 under control so that we can reopen our businesses and schools safely, resume our lives, and put this pandemic behind us. https://t.co/65C1XfR9rR. The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing, and so is the need for bold action to fight this pandemic.. My COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board will advise on detailed plans built on a bedrock of science, and that keep compassion, empathy, and care for every American at its core.. Today, I have named a COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board, comprised of distinguished public health experts, to help our transition team translate the Biden-Harris COVID-19 plan into a blueprint we can put into place as soon as @KamalaHarris and I are sworn into office.. I spent the morning with the co-chairs of my COVID-19 Council discussing the status of this pandemic and how we move forward. Tune in as I provide an update on how we're going to beat this virus. https://t.co/VVGHZNnUFY. With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with a love of country <U+0097> and a thirst for justice <U+0097> let us be the nation that we know we can be.. Tonight, the whole world is watching America. I believe at our best America is a beacon for the globe.

And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.. Especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest <U+0097> the African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I<U+0092>ll have yours.. I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate.

That<U+0092>s the choice I<U+0092>ll make. And I call on the Congress <U+0097> Democrats and Republicans alike <U+0097> to make that choice with me.. Now that the campaign is over<U+0097>what is the people<U+0092>s will? What is our mandate?

I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life<U+0092>s most precious moments <U+0097> hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us <U+0097> until we get this virus under control.. The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season <U+0097> a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal.

This is the time to heal in America.. It<U+0092>s time to put away the harsh rhetoric.

To lower the temperature.

To see each other again.

To listen to each other again.. To all those who volunteered, worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local election officials <U+0097> you deserve a special thanks from this nation.. For America<U+0092>s educators, this is a great day: You<U+0092>re going to have one of your own in the White House, and Jill is going to make a great First Lady.. I pledge to be a President who seeks not to divide, but to unify.

Who doesn<U+0092>t see Red and Blue states, but a United States.

And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people.. Folks, the people of this nation have spoken.

They have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory.

A victory for <U+0093>We the People.<U+0094>. A new day in America has come. Tune in as Vice President-Elect @KamalaHarris and I address the nation. https://t.co/d38F58DHu8. America, I<U+0092>m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country.

The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans <U+0097> whether you voted for me or not.

I will keep the faith that you have placed in me. https://t.co/moA9qhmjn8. I know tensions can be high after a tough election like we just had.

But we need to remain calm. Patient. And let the process work out as we count all the votes.. We are going to be the first Democrats to win Arizona in 24 years.

We are going to be the first Democrats to win Georgia in 28 years.

And we re-built the Blue Wall in the middle of the country that crumbled just four years ago.. What is becoming clearer each hour is that record numbers of Americans <U+0097> from all races, faiths, regions <U+0097> chose change over more of the same. 

They have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism.. Donald Trump is going to court to stop votes from being counted. We have assembled the largest election protection effort in history to fight back and need your help.

Chip in to make sure every vote is counted: https://t.co/ksrwxu9nDE. No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now, not ever.

America has come too far, fought too many battles, and endured too much to let that happen.. I spent the afternoon attending briefings on the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and the state of the economy. Tune in as I provide an update on these briefings and efforts to count every vote. https://t.co/duoDWfzf5C. Democracy is sometimes messy, so sometimes it requires a little patience. 

But that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance that has been the envy of the world.. We<U+0092>re fighting to ensure every last vote is counted across the country <U+0097> and we need your help to do it. Chip in to the Biden Fight Fund to fuel our election protection efforts: https://t.co/VsuxvtqAFa. As votes continue to be counted across the country, tune in as my campaign manager @jomalleydillon and campaign adviser Bob Bauer give an update on where things stand. https://t.co/sKReFhHU5j. Donald Trump does not decide the outcome of this election and nor do I. The American people decide. That<U+0092>s why we<U+0092>ve launched the Biden Fight Fund <U+0097> to ensure every vote is counted.

Chip in to help fund our election protection efforts across the country: https://t.co/ps6VhGy0m5. I<U+0092>m confident that we will emerge victorious.

But this will not be my victory alone.

It will be a victory for the American people. https://t.co/ZqJBVsQuQf. Today, the Trump Administration officially left the Paris Climate Agreement. And in exactly 77 days, a Biden Administration will rejoin it. https://t.co/L8UJimS6v2. I am confident we will emerge victorious, but this will not be my victory or our victory alone. It will be a victory for the American people, for our democracy, for America.. Once this election is finalized and behind us, it will be time for us to do what we've always done as Americans: To put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us.. The presidency, itself, is not a partisan institution. It's the one office in the nation that represents everyone and it demands a duty of care for all Americans, and that is precisely what I will do.. Power can't be taken or asserted, it flows from the people, and it's their will that determines who will be the President of the United States.. To make sure every vote is counted, we<U+0092>re setting up the largest election protection effort ever assembled. Because Donald Trump doesn<U+0092>t get to decide the outcome of this election <U+0097> the American people do.

Chip in to power the new Biden Fight Fund: https://t.co/1hCoKB0QfP. We won't rest until everyone's vote is counted. Tune in as my campaign manager @jomalleydillon and campaign adviser Bob Bauer give an update on where the race stands. https://t.co/Rwz4iR25B3.

Today, I<U+0092>m asking for your trust once again <U+0097> this time, in Kamala and me.

We can heal the soul of this nation <U+0097> I promise we won<U+0092>t let you down.

https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/VwZkmZ53F4. I<U+0092>m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.

I will work with Democrats and Republicans, and I<U+0092>ll work as hard for those who don<U+0092>t support me as for those who do.

Because that<U+0092>s the job of a president.. Under President Trump:

- Over 230,000 Americans have died from COVID-19
- 30 million people have lost hours, paychecks, or jobs
- Nearly one in five small businesses have closed

Are you better off than you were four years ago?. As president, I will:

<U+0096> Combat climate change
<U+0096> Create millions of good-paying, union jobs

We choose hope over fear. Unity over division. Science over fiction. And truth over lies.. If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can<U+0092>t let that happen.. I believe health care is a right for all.

Donald Trump believes it's a privilege for the few.

It's that simple, folks.. I believe LGBTQ+ rights are human rights <U+0097> and they are on the ballot tomorrow.

Take a look: https://t.co/RKvVwr2J8q. I<U+0092>ve said it many times: I<U+0092>m more optimistic about America<U+0092>s future today than I was when I got elected to the United States Senate as a 29-year-old.. Donald Trump will always fight for his wealthy and well-connected friends. I<U+0092>ll always fight for you.. Who we are. What we believe. Who we want to be. It<U+0092>s all at stake tomorrow.

Donald Trump is the worst jobs president in modern history.

And just like everything else he<U+0092>s inherited in life, he squandered it..

A Biden-Harris administration will:

- Implement nationwide mask mandates
- Ensure access to regular, reliable, and free testing
- Accelerate the development and distribution of safe and effective treatments and vaccines

We won<U+0092>t waste any time getting this virus under control.. Health care.

Racial justice.
The Supreme Court.
Our democracy.

In private, he told Bob Woodward it was deadlier than the flu and that he wanted to downplay it.

As president, I<U+0092>ll ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, implement universal background checks, and enact other common-sense reforms to end our gun violence epidemic.. More than 230,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 <U+0096><U+0096> and Donald Trump has given up on trying to get the virus under control.

Vote. https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB. The Trump Administration knew how deadly this virus was back in February.

But they didn't tell you or your family. Instead, they gave a heads up to their friends on Wall Street so investors could make a profit before the recession hit.

They hid the truth. It's unforgivable.. Folks, there are just three days left to vote in this election, and we need your help to get people to the polls. Text three friends or family members and make sure they have a plan to vote. https://t.co/xu4mk3W5x2. Desde sus actos atroces con la separaci<f3>n de familias en nuestra frontera hasta su ignorancia con el pueblo puertorriqe<f1>o despu<e9>s del hurac<e1>n Mar<ed>a, el presidente Trump ha atacado la dignidad de las familias latinas una y otra vez.

Esto terminar<e1> cuando yo sea presidente.. If you<U+0092>re sick or struggling or worried about how you<U+0092>ll get through the day: I want you to know that I see you, and I won<U+0092>t forget you.

You can count on me to fight for you every day in the White House.. From his heinous acts of separating families at our border to his neglect of the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, President Trump has attacked the dignity of Latino families time and time again.

It will end when I<U+0092>m president.. My faith has been a source of immeasurable solace in times of grief and a daily inspiration to fight against the abuse of power in all its forms.

It<U+0092>s why I<U+0092>ll be a president for all Americans <U+0097> Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike <U+0097> because I believe we must work together if we<U+0092>re going to get anything done.. .@BarackObama and I have seen the office of the presidency up close, we know what the job entails, and there's too much at stake to give Donald Trump another four years.

Vote: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/7imuWqlZSN. The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.

We can<U+0092>t take another four years of Donald Trump<U+0092>s failed leadership.. 64 years ago today, freedom-loving Hungarians revolted against communist rule. Their spirit inspired the Prague Spring, Poland's Solidarity movement, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. As president, I'll always stand in defense of democracy and freedom at home and around the world.. After eight months of this pandemic, we finally found President Trump's plan to beat COVID-19. https://t.co/KO4g328Uvr. .@BarackObama is right: President Trump wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic he ignored. https://t.co/tCD5UST32J. The character of our country is on the ballot.

Last night<U+0092>s debate showed once and for all that the choice is as clear as ever, and the stakes are as high as ever.

I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I will represent you <U+0097> whether you vote for me or against me.. Decency, honor, respect, treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance.

I'm going to make sure you get that. You haven't been getting it the last four years. https://t.co/KhQIGGZHIH. Kids were ripped from their parents<U+0092> arms, and now they can't find their parents.

We have never lived up to it, but we<U+0092>ve never stopped trying <U+0097> until this President.. This isn<U+0092>t about Donald Trump<U+0092>s family or my family. This is about your family.

Families across America are hurting <U+0097> but that<U+0092>s the last thing Donald Trump wants to talk about. https://t.co/qWMgnLHxKY. All Donald Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street.

He thinks the economy is doing well if the Dow Jones is doing well.

Believe it or not, Mr. President, most Americans don't live off the stock market.. We<U+0092>ve been waiting years for President Trump to reveal his grand plan for health care, and he still has nothing to show.

I<U+0092>ve laid out exactly what I<U+0092>ll do. Take a look: https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C. It<U+0092>s not about his family or my family. It<U+0092>s about your family.

If you<U+0092>re a middle-class family right now, you<U+0092>re hurting badly.. I am proud that the average contribution to my campaign is $43.

Chip in to power our grassroots movement through this final stretch: https://t.co/foyJuIKiYo. I don<U+0092>t look at this the way Donald Trump does <U+0097> blue states or red states. They<U+0092>re all the United States.. 220,000 deaths.

Tune in at 9 PM ET as I go head-to-head with Donald Trump for the last time before Election Day.. Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.

I see it from where I came from: Scranton, Pennsylvania. 

It's why I'll fight every day as president to make this country work for the middle class <U+0097> not the wealthy and well-connected.. I<U+0092>m always talking about my plans to build back better for all Americans. But what does that really mean for you and your family? 

Watch as @ewarren helps explain: https://t.co/ti7QJCU7j0. On this International Stuttering Awareness Day, I want everyone to remember that the barriers you face don't define who you are. They didn't for me <U+0096><U+0096> as a young boy who stuttered <U+0096><U+0096> and they certainly don't for Brayden.

What defines you is your heart and your courage. https://t.co/zoVPzmroJh. Folks, it's go-time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes <U+0097> and you can make all the difference.

https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB https://t.co/deCh7bW9IS. <U+0093>If we pour all our efforts into these 13 days, if we vote up and down the ticket like never before, then we will not only elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we will also leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for.<U+0094> <U+0097> @BarackObama

https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/EOmHJ4wrnD. America was an idea. We've never lived up to it but we've never walked away from it before.

https://t.co/uoiVh9ZqzI https://t.co/clVe9wpOMi. America is a nation that values immigrants. It is and has always been one of our greatest strengths.

We need a president who understands that. https://t.co/fIuNJUrfY3. A few weeks ago, I spoke to Mr. Rogers<U+0092> wife Joanne when I was in her neighborhood in Pittsburgh. It was a great conversation.

They<U+0092>re tired of your lies about this virus. They<U+0092>re tired of watching more Americans die, and more people lose their jobs because you refuse to take this pandemic seriously. https://t.co/pdxdo3FadB. Waving a white flag and saying, <U+0093>it is what it is<U+0094> is unacceptable when thousands are dying each week, when businesses are closing, and when schools remain shuttered. The American people have never backed down from a challenge, but they need a leader to show the way.. Yesterday, @realDonaldTrump decided to attack Dr. Fauci once again, calling him a <U+0091>disaster<U+0092> and public health experts <U+0091>idiots.<U+0092> Meanwhile, he still has no plan to beat this virus.. If you live in Hawaii, Utah, or Wisconsin, in-person early voting is now underway.

Head to https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB before it's too late.. The simple, sad truth is that this president is not in office to serve the American people. He<U+0092>s in it to serve himself.

@KamalaHarris and I are in this for you and your families. https://t.co/mV9ONHhn1b. Pennsylvania <U+0097> there are just a few hours left to register to vote online.

@KamalaHarris and I will work every day to bind up our wounds and bring this country back together. https://t.co/hsy8JIIAqk. Together, we can put an end to the last four years of darkness, division, and chaos.

We can unite, mend our wounds, and begin to heal.

It starts at the ballot box: https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 https://t.co/bmpMpedpdQ. You have the power to own the outcome of this election <U+0097> but only if you vote.

We are in a battle for the soul of the nation. 

The forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down, and holding us back.

We must free ourselves of all of them.. The truth is things in life are easier when you have a plan <U+0097> and that includes voting. So my team set up a tool to help you make your plan to vote. Check it out: https://t.co/uoiVh9ZqzI. From tackling climate change to making community college free for all <U+0097> I've got big plans for the country.

I<U+0092>ve spent my entire career fighting for a more just, safe, and prosperous America <U+0097> and I<U+0092>m not finished yet. https://t.co/cS3LPT7afX. COVID-19 cases are on the rise across the nation.

But instead of leading by example, Donald Trump continues to put others in danger with his campaign events that ignore expert-recommended precautions.

Every day he proves just how unfit he is to lead America through this crisis.. I<U+0092>m in Durham, North Carolina, encouraging folks to make their plan to vote early. Tune in <U+0097> and then head to https://t.co/uoiVh9HPb8 to make yours. https://t.co/lNw7Jxuh65. Folks, if you live in Illinois, today is your last day to register to vote online. Don<U+0092>t wait, head to https://t.co/MNWeBHjGLh and register before it<U+0092>s too late.. I often think about what it takes for a Black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country that, for far too long, has not been recognized.

It<U+0092>s time we fulfilled our nation<U+0092>s founding promise: equality for all. 

Here<U+0092>s how we<U+0092>ll do it: https://t.co/wH2hVq7UL2. A job is about a lot more than a paycheck.

It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything will be okay.

Too many people today can't do that <U+0097> and it's got to change.. Every day we're reminded just how much is at stake in this election. We can't afford to have anyone sit on the sidelines.

Vote. https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB. In the middle of a pandemic, President Trump is trying to eliminate Obamacare and increase health care costs for millions.

Now, he<U+0092>s rushing through a U.S. Supreme Court justice to help him get it done. It<U+0092>s unconscionable. 

Make no mistake: Health care is on the ballot.. If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other <U+0097> then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future. 

That is our work. That is our pledge. That is our mission.. This election is bigger than any one candidate. 

It's about the future of our economy, our health care, our climate, our commitment to racial justice, our democracy <U+0096><U+0096> and so much more.

We have to vote. https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB. As president, I<U+0092>ll protect and build on Obamacare by:

Now, I need your help. Chip in to power our campaign through this final stretch. https://t.co/OcFsE3oMHq. If I'm elected president, you won't hear me race-baiting, you won't hear me dividing <U+0097> you'll hear me trying to unify. https://t.co/PNsBW8OQmX. I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm going to be an American president. 

I'm going to take care of those who voted against me as well as those who voted for me. 

That's what presidents do.. We're a diverse country <U+0097> and unless we are able to treat people equally, we're just never going to meet our potential.. Folks, I hope I<U+0092>m making you proud during tonight<U+0092>s town hall.

If you<U+0092>re with us, please chip in to help power our campaign over these final 19 days. https://t.co/rA9WmMPRxs. Two of the things I've cared about throughout my whole career:

1. Improving the criminal justice system.
2. Putting Black Americans in a position to gain generational wealth.

And as president, I will continue that fight every day.. Let me be very clear: If you make under $400,000 you won<U+0092>t pay a penny more in taxes under my administration.. The words of a president matter. And when a president doesn't wear a mask or makes fun of folks who do, it has consequences.. We're eight months into this pandemic, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a plan to get this virus under control.

I do.. I<U+0092>m about to step on stage for tonight<U+0092>s town hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tune in to @ABC to watch live.. This is not a moment <U+0097> it's a movement.

We wanted to take a moment to clear up some of the lies he<U+0092>s been saying about us. https://t.co/QWqXp3qdSD. Our campaign<U+0092>s contact tracing remains ongoing, and my team will continue to share any significant developments with the American people. If anything, let this serve as an example of the importance of wearing masks and keeping a safe, social distance.. Not only was the individual 50+ feet away and wearing a mask, but I was wearing an N-95 mask. No members of my staff were in contact with this crew member either.  My doctors have advised that there is no need for me to quarantine.. During our contact tracing, we discovered around noon today that a member of the company that charters my airplane has also tested positive for COVID. This crew member was on the plane with me, but was more than 50 feet away. 

My COVID test from last night came back negative.. Donald Trump is rushing through Justice Ginsburg's replacement because he's laser-focused on destroying the Affordable Care Act. 

Here's what's at stake: https://t.co/W7kluAVe2l. President Obama and I left Donald Trump a booming economy <U+0097> and he caused a recession.

There's still more work to be done, but I wanted to share the good news with Trimicka, one of our grassroots supporters. https://t.co/f9hIPT6PTW. If President Trump has his way in the U.S. Supreme Court, long-term complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, will become pre-existing conditions that could result in higher premiums or denied coverage.

It<U+0092>s that simple, folks.. If President Trump is successful in forcing through his nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, it will likely repeal the ACA and 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions will lose their protections.

And now he sees an opportunity to finally get it done, all while ignoring the will of the people.

We can<U+0092>t let him.. I am ready to fight for you and for our nation. Every day. Without exception, without reservation. And with a full and devoted heart.. We need a president who will unite our country and bring out our best <U+0097> not one who stokes division and brings out our worst..

Join us live from Cincinnati as we get out the vote: https://t.co/oMwv9s2sLE. Donald Trump is running TV ads taking Dr. Fauci out of context and without his permission.

So, here<U+0092>s a message from the President in his own words. https://t.co/WCYbIfrQLR. I know Americans aren<U+0092>t looking for a handout.

Hope over fear.

Vote. https://t.co/eoxT07uII9. In January, I said President Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis. And everything we<U+0092>ve been through in the months since has proven that to be true. https://t.co/twcy3Ql0Xc. When President Trump was told one thousand Americans were dying every day from COVID-19, he shrugged it off and said, ""it is what it is.""

It is what it is?

This president doesn't even pretend to care about the Americans he swore to serve. It's disgraceful.. Today we join Polish-Americans in celebrating General Pulaski, whose heroism built the American cavalry and saved the life of George Washington. America will always stand with the Polish people against the common threats we face.. Today, let's all celebrate the one billion girls and young women around the world <U+0097> and recommit to fight for their education, work, health, rights, and opportunities. A Biden-Harris administration will work to elevate their voices and ensure an equal future. #DayOfTheGirl.

More than 25 million Americans are on unemployment.
Millions are at risk of losing their homes.

But President Trump doesn<U+0092>t seem to care. He only cares about how he and his wealthy friends are doing.. America has to be about the possibilities of prosperity. 

Not just for the privileged few. But for the many <U+0097> for all of us.. The fact is this pandemic has exposed the cracks in our already broken mental health care system.

We can and must do better.

As president, I<U+0092>ll fight to achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. #WorldMentalHealthDay. I<U+0092>m in Erie, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plans to build back better. Tune in. https://t.co/8NqGra1egn. We're eight months into this crisis, and this president still has no plan to rebuild our economy.

I do. I'll get America back to work <U+0097> and build back better.

Here's how: https://t.co/XjiTnHDiUk. What does building back better mean for you?

- Millions of new, good-paying jobs
- A $15 federal minimum wage
- Stronger benefits and fair workplaces
- An economy that works for everyone<U+0097>not just the wealthy
- The choice to join a union

That's the future we can build together.. If you're sick, struggling, or worried about how you're going to get through the day <U+0097> know you are not alone.

We're all in this together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before. https://t.co/ztiKctOcHW. To all my fellow Delawareans <U+0097> today is your last day to register to vote.

It<U+0092>s estimated that nearly another 200,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year because of this virus.

With global hunger on the march, made worse by the pandemic and conflict around the world, we must come together to fight food insecurity. As president, I'll support the WFP and reassert American leadership to address global hunger. https://t.co/mt5uwCG5zT. What we need in America is leadership that seeks to de-escalate tensions, to open lines of communication, and to bring us together. To heal <U+0097> and to hope.

As president, that is precisely what I will do.. When Governor Whitmer worked to protect her state from a deadly pandemic, President Trump issued a call to ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN!""

That call was heard.

He's giving oxygen to the bigotry and hate we see on the march in our country <U+0097> and we have to stop it.. Jill and I are keeping the Gulf Coast in our prayers tonight. If you<U+0092>re in Hurricane Delta<U+0092>s path, please heed the advice of local officials, take steps to prepare, and stay safe. https://t.co/GAtLxm1n3S. Time and time again, President Trump has refused to condemn white supremacy and stoked the flames of hate for political gain.

It<U+0092>s a pattern <U+0097> and America deserves better. https://t.co/o1zKKd0bpf. .@CP3 and @StephenCurry30 know exactly what it means to finish strong down the stretch. We<U+0092>re in the closing days of this campaign, and it<U+0092>s time to finish this fight and cast our ballots. 

Don<U+0092>t miss your shot: Register to vote today at https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB. https://t.co/Xek40JpcUc. After last night, I just had to write a note about my friend and running mate, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/FYPXV5dZZG. .@KamalaHarris is right: If you have a pre-existing condition, the Trump Administration is coming for you.

Vote like your health care depends on it <U+0097> because it does.

https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB https://t.co/Nf4IJZvL7U. Last night, @KamalaHarris chose truth over lies.

She chose hope and unity over fear and division.

Tune in as @KamalaHarris and I kick off our Soul of the Nation bus tour from Phoenix, Arizona. https://t.co/0BukV7xBJq. Every generation that has followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment when it must answer this question: Will we allow the sacrifices made in that battle, and that war, to be in vain?
 
We cannot, and we must not. It's time to come together. https://t.co/jmVGQRS4zy. Folks, there was only one person on last night<U+0092>s debate stage who<U+0092>s fit to serve as Vice President <U+0097> and her name is @KamalaHarris.. We must seek not to build walls, but bridges.

We must seek not to clench our fists, but to open our arms.

We must seek not to tear each other apart, but to come together.. Donald Trump has made hate, division, and dog whistles central to his campaign from the very beginning <U+0096> and last week he couldn't even condemn white supremacists. It<U+0092>s a pattern.. Let me be clear: A Biden-Harris Administration won't increase taxes by a dime on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.. .@KamalaHarris is showing the American people why I chose her as my running mate. She<U+0092>s smart, she<U+0092>s experienced, she<U+0092>s a proven fighter for the middle class. She<U+0092>ll be an incredible Vice President.. We<U+0092>re eight months into this pandemic and Donald Trump and Mike Pence still have no plan to deal with COVID-19. He<U+0092>s still hoping it will just <U+0093>disappear.<U+0094>

@KamalaHarris and I have a comprehensive, science-backed plan to defeat this virus.

Take a look: https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD. .@KamalaHarris is about to take the debate stage <U+0096><U+0096> but before she does, I need your help.

https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB https://t.co/TLHRYSjbTx. Folks, I know a thing or two about vice presidential debates.

In 2008, I squared off against Governor Palin. And in 2012, I called out Congressman Ryan's malarkey.

I know @KamalaHarris will do a great job. Join me and tune in at 9 PM ET to cheer her on.. These families fled persecution and violence to seek safety in the land of the free.

But instead of providing refuge, the Trump Administration ripped their children away from them.

- Implement nationwide mask mandates
- Ensure access to regular, reliable, and free testing
- Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines

I won<U+0092>t waste any time getting this virus under control.. I can<U+0092>t wait for @KamalaHarris to make history at tomorrow night<U+0092>s debate. Before she takes the stage, don<U+0092>t miss this event with @MindyKaling, @PadmaLakshmi, @DJCassidy, and more.

If we give the Trump Administration another four years, we'll lose irreplaceable time to combat it. https://t.co/cexxSVQLOQ. Make no mistake: if you are out of work, if your business is closed, if your child<U+0092>s school is shut down, if you are seeing layoffs in your community, Donald Trump decided today that none of that matters to him.. I give you my word: If I am elected president, I will marshal the ingenuity and goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together.. As president, I will embrace:

Hope, not fear.
Peace, not violence.
Generosity, not greed.
Light, not darkness. 

I will be a president who appeals to the best in us. Not the worst.. We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all.

And by fits and starts, our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation.

Those better angels must prevail again.. The pandemic is not a red state versus blue state issue. The virus doesn<U+0092>t care where you live or what political party you belong to.

It infects us all. It will take anyone<U+0092>s life. It is a virus <U+0097> not a political weapon.. As president, I will send a clear, unequivocal message to the entire nation: There is no place for hate in America.

It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It will be given no safe harbor.. We are engaged once again in a battle for the soul of the nation. It<U+0092>s a battle we<U+0092>ve been in before and we can win again. Tune in as I deliver remarks from Gettysburg. https://t.co/I9KItf8Fjn.

Peaceful protesters, police officers, unions, and civil rights groups <U+0097> we'll all sit down at the White House. https://t.co/qk4Nh65UIC. When I decided to run, I had three objectives:

1. Restore the soul of this country.
2. Rebuild the middle class.
3. Reunite the country.

It's the only way we can move forward. https://t.co/Wk3uP0Qcqm. More than 200,000 Americans have died. 50,000 Americans are getting the virus every day. 1,000 a day are dying. This is a national emergency.

The President should take responsibility. https://t.co/RpEZCjjUhq. I would hope that the President having gone through what he went through will communicate the right lesson to the American people: Masks matter. They save lives. https://t.co/Hc8lovKEwB.

That's who we are <U+0097> and there is nothing we cannot do if we do it together.. Be a patriot. Do your part.

Wearing a mask will protect you. But it will also protect those around you <U+0097> your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your co-worker.

Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.. Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response:

- Over 200,000 Americans have died
- 26 million are on unemployment
- 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure

We can<U+0092>t let him.. When I first ran for Senate, we put up a billboard that said, <U+0093>Joe Biden: For all our families.<U+0094>

It<U+0092>s a motto that has guided me throughout my career.

It doesn<U+0092>t matter if you<U+0092>re a Democrat or Republican<U+0097>I<U+0092>ll be a president for all Americans, not just the ones who vote for me.. On Native Women's Equal Pay Day, we recognize the hard truth that Native women earn just $0.57 for every dollar a white man makes. It's unacceptable.

We're in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for stop three of the Build Back Better Express Tour. Tune in now to watch. https://t.co/KoGBkEKUxS.

I took the Amtrak from Wilmington to Washington, D.C., every day for 36 years. The journey became routine, but the hardworking men and women I met along the way became dear friends. https://t.co/kyikjGKFQ9. Enough with the racist dog whistles, Donald.

Chip in to help beat Donald Trump: https://t.co/qenDA6FsjW. You heard a lot come out of President Trump<U+0092>s mouth. Can you name one thing he said to actually make your life better?. You have it in your control to determine what this country<U+0092>s gonna look like the next four years. Is it going to change <U+0096><U+0096> or are you going to get four more years of these lies? https://t.co/eoxT07uII9. Under this president, we have become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent. 

When I was vice president, we inherited a recession, I was asked to fix it, and I did.

We left Donald Trump a booming economy, and he caused a recession. https://t.co/uEMPaTtZ7F. Donald Trump isn't a law and order president. He's a president who breaks the law and creates disorder.. Donald Trump talks a lot about the art of the deal. But under his watch, China has perfected the art of the steal. https://t.co/OSTsHHTtBQ. More jobs were created in the final three years of the Obama-Biden Administration than in the first three years of Donald Trump<U+0092>s presidency.

When Donald Trump was presented with that number, he said, <U+0093>It is what it is.<U+0094>

It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is. https://t.co/OOm2pVRijz. When I hear 200,000 deaths, I think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones.

It didn<U+0092>t have to be this bad.. President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he<U+0092>s in Court trying to rip their protections away.

And now, he<U+0092>s trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done.

We can<U+0092>t let him win.. I<U+0092>m about to step on stage to debate Donald Trump for the first time. But before I do, can you chip in to show him the power of our grassroots base? Every donation <U+0097> big or small <U+0097> goes a long way. https://t.co/HiNSLIqIPQ. If we<U+0092>re elected, @KamalaHarris and I will wake up every single morning to fight for the middle class.

With casualties rapidly mounting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, the Trump Administration needs to call the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan immediately to de-escalate the situation. It must also demand others <U+0097> like Turkey <U+0097> stay out of this conflict. https://t.co/C41YKEGTyA. The American people understand the urgency of this moment. They're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance.

But Donald Trump doesn't care <U+0097> he sees a chance to eliminate Obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions.

It's unconscionable.. I believe there's no greater economic engine in the world than the hard work and ingenuity of the American people <U+0097> and I witnessed it firsthand last week in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

Together, we're going to make sure the future is made here in America. https://t.co/tw7tv6sPKT. Folks, this is a big week for our campaign: Tomorrow, I face Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first time <U+0097> and Wednesday is our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline.

I'm not looking to punish anyone, but it's about time the super-wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share.. Whether it's $7.50, $75, or $750 <U+0097> every donation makes a big difference during this final stretch.

Chip in to help us get Donald Trump out of the White House: https://t.co/ttsZXljWG1. President Trump can claim he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions all he wants <U+0097> but the fact is he<U+0092>s fighting tooth and nail to take their protections away.. How much more did you pay in taxes than President Trump?

Head to https://t.co/h9ZZ0iBuiE to find out. https://t.co/w689uVoHq7. Here's the deal: Until we deal with COVID-19, we'll never get our economy fully back on track, get our kids safely back to school, or get our lives back.

It's why as president, I won't waste a day getting this virus under control. https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3. There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years <U+0097> and now they see an opening to get it done.

We can't let them get away with it.. On this Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, Jill and I are keeping the loved ones of our fallen heroes in our prayers.

May you have an easy and meaningful fast. And may you be sealed in the Book of Life. https://t.co/z4EMRDH8Y5. The truth is the economy wasn<U+0092>t working for folks long before these crises hit. It<U+0092>s why @KamalaHarris and I won<U+0092>t just build back to the way things were <U+0097> we<U+0092>ll build back better. We won<U+0092>t be satisfied until the economy starts working for everyone.. The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court affect our everyday lives <U+0097> and the American people deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to who serves on the Court. Tune in as I deliver remarks on President Trump<U+0092>s nomination. https://t.co/N9HmjDXKMw. Thank you @TheRock for your support at this critical moment for our nation.

You said it best: This election is about earning the respect of the American people. It<U+0092>s about decency. It<U+0092>s about electing leaders who tell the truth.

Thanks again, DJ. Next time we<U+0092>re talking cars. https://t.co/V5kHR5fQbe. In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him destroy Obamacare.

Health care is at stake. Protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake.

We can't let them win. https://t.co/zIdPmxzYtQ. Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions.

The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.

Americans deserve to be heard.. Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court <U+0097> a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court<U+0092>s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act.

Vote like your health care is on the ballot <U+0097> because it is. https://t.co/TDBQOVLP4K. When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus.

After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously ""disappear.""

Now, over 200,000 lives have been cut short.

It's a national tragedy.. At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change.

We need a president who believes in science.. Today is Public Lands Day and National Hunting and Fishing Day <U+0097> and what better way to celebrate than the long overdue removal of William Perry Pendley from @blmnational. It's a victory for everyone who values our public lands over those who want to exploit them for profit. https://t.co/lZxDF4PzH6. If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19.

Minutes after the race is called, I<U+0092>ll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on.

During my transition, I<U+0092>ll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating.

It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office <U+0097> to care, for everyone.. We are in the middle of a climate emergency <U+0097> and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet.

We have to vote him out. https://t.co/NkSJ7bvBoE. Obamacare was<U+0097>and is<U+0097>a big deal. As president, I<U+0092>ll protect and build on it, lower health care costs, and give Americans the opportunity to choose a new public option.

We<U+0092>re going to make sure everyone has access to the affordable health care they need. https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C.

John and I didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward <U+0097> it's what I'll do every day as president. https://t.co/KheAlsKt73. I've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. I applaud Congress for passing Savanna's Act this week.

Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better..

They are arguing to strip millions of Americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic.

We can't let him win. https://t.co/bcwiGz1HOn. In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow..

The 200,000 people we've lost to COVID-19 weren't nobodies, Mr. President.

Here's how we'll advance racial economic equity: https://t.co/Tjgyn1gR2V. I<U+0092>ve dealt with guys like Donald Trump my whole life.

Guys who look down on you because they<U+0092>ve got a lot of money.

Guys who think they<U+0092>re better than you.

Guys who inherited everything they ever got in life <U+0097> and then squandered it. https://t.co/o4q5M6VuJC. We can<U+0092>t let 2016 repeat itself. There<U+0092>s simply too much on the line for anyone to sit this election out.

I see the world from where I grew up: Scranton, Pennsylvania.. 200,000 Americans have died from this virus.

It<U+0092>s a staggering number that<U+0092>s hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same.

There<U+0092>s a devastating human toll to this pandemic <U+0097> and we can<U+0092>t forget that.. While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing.

Now, nearly 200,000 Americans have died.

It didn<U+0092>t have to happen this way. https://t.co/RqdLtARlRW. Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost.

Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you.

Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith.. Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country <U+0097> and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.. When the virus came, President Trump wasn<U+0092>t thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection.

It<U+0092>s how Trump looks at the world: It<U+0092>s always about him, never about us.

You deserve a president who will put you first.. Thank you for the warm welcome, Manitowoc!

Debemos actuar para asegurarnos de que nada como esto vuelva a suceder y asegurar que Puerto Rico reciba la dignidad y el respeto que se merece. https://t.co/x0Hvmq7Qnz. Our frontline workers have sacrificed so much during this pandemic <U+0097> the least President Trump could do is tell them the truth. https://t.co/TuLCCfnRHx. Tune in as I deliver remarks on the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the future of the Supreme Court. https://t.co/i9CleOZIol. Tune in as I deliver remarks on the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the future of the Supreme Court. https://t.co/hXc7OOykxh. It was my honor to preside over Justice Ginsburg<U+0092>s confirmation hearings, and to support her accession to the Supreme Court. Her opinions, and her dissents, will shape the basis of our law for generations to come <U+0097> and we<U+0092>ll be a more just and equal nation because of it. https://t.co/SmZD2KyyyG. The Supreme Court is on the ballot. And the outcome will impact everything from health care to civil rights <U+0097> affecting generations to come. 

Vote. Our future depends on it. https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life<U+0092>s work, we are closer to that more perfect union we<U+0092>ve always strived to be. https://t.co/o30ZCuj10G. Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.. Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.. Jill and I wish our friends in the Jewish community a very healthy and happy New Year. As we mark this new beginning, let us commit to pursuing peace and justice in the year ahead. #RoshHashanah. Amy is right: our democracy depends on your vote. And you don't have to wait until November to cast your ballot.

If you're in Minnesota, head to https://t.co/NGRGPSBJok and make your plan to vote today. https://t.co/l5tXeDRdtT. Let's be honest: my campaign wouldn't be here if it weren't for the support of Black Americans. And I know we don't have a chance to win without your support.

I'll do everything I can to earn your vote<U+0097>and together, we'll build a nation that works for all. #NationalBlackVoterDay https://t.co/5JPtuHey5Z. Virginia <U+0097> early voting is now open!

This is our moment.

Democracy depends on it. https://t.co/VNlujjvN7F. Frankie <U+0097> I'm honored to have your support and couldn't agree more: We are at our best when we act as one America. Together, we're going to unite the country and restore the soul of the nation. https://t.co/0VFApM5Oee. A Biden-Harris administration will create millions of good-paying, union jobs and ensure the future is made in America <U+0097> by all of America. I<U+0092>m speaking live from Hermantown, MN on how we<U+0092>ll get it done. Tune in. https://t.co/ZFxVgWUt7n. I can't believe I have to say this, but if I'm elected president, I won't put a climate change denier <U+0097> one who called the scientific community ""a bunch of thugs"" <U+0097> in charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. https://t.co/FcRtv8ZcYS. When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us.

When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.

When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.

It's unforgivable.. Donald Trump claimed he would be ""the greatest jobs president God ever created.""

But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history.

We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. https://t.co/uW10KJhMsV. Folks, I just wrapped up my first CNN Town Hall of the general election. We<U+0092>re in the home stretch of this campaign and your support matters more than ever.

Chip in to help us keep tonight<U+0092>s momentum going: https://t.co/J2E4dtxGEK. Unlike President Trump, I<U+0092>ll be a president for all Americans <U+0097> not just the ones who vote for me. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/2lttWNRl5n. Here's the deal: I've condemned every form of violence, no matter what the source is. President Trump has not. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/kqoaJRLYMn. As president, I will bring Americans together and finally deliver much needed policing reform. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/7iwYuXOS2p. I<U+0092>m in this race to fight for the hardworking Americans who wake up every single day and make our country run. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/vOiOl9UK5f. I'll tell you what takes away your freedom: not being able to see your kid, go to the football game, or see your mom or dad in the hospital. That's what is costing us our freedom. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/YM57H8lv2K. The choice in this election couldn<U+0092>t be more clear.

We can choose four more years of Donald Trump<U+0092>s dark and divisive politics.

Or we can choose a path of hope and light<U+0097>and build a better future for all.

Chip in to help us win. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/a1aSMb7x1G. I<U+0092>m about to take the stage for tonight<U+0092>s Town Hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Tune in to @CNN now to watch live. https://t.co/zi0P1gcAiU. Donald Trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class Americans.

We need a president who cares about more than the wealthy and well-connected.. I<U+0092>m looking forward to being back in my home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for tonight<U+0092>s CNN Town Hall. Tune in at 8 PM ET to watch. https://t.co/yHez7c4gaq. No surprise, Donald Trump is lying about my tax plan. Here<U+0092>s the truth about how I<U+0092>ll make corporations pay their fair share while ensuring Americans making under $400,000 don<U+0092>t pay a penny more. https://t.co/0cpJjpCS33. Ahead of #RoshHashanah, Jill and I want to wish everyone in the Jewish community a very happy, healthy, and sweet New Year. Tune in to our virtual event: https://t.co/ECEfGRqX5n. The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis.
 
Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break.
 
Let that sink in.. If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.

The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share <U+0097> and we'll invest that money in working families.

We're going to reward work <U+0097> not wealth.. .@realDonaldTrump, the job is to be president of all Americans. For the love of God start acting like it. https://t.co/kkHf9aWZmR. We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing. 
 
We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.

The stakes are too high.. Yesterday, I met with some of our nation's top experts to discuss how we distribute a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. If I win this election, I know that there won't be a minute to waste. I'll get to work on day one implementing an effective distribution plan. https://t.co/GfgSnBwjTQ. President Trump promised the opioid crisis would end ""quickly"" if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. It's heartbreaking.

As president, I promise I'll take action to end this epidemic. https://t.co/tnVAqXbXpm. If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if more of America is ablaze? https://t.co/DwCIoNkwk1. When I said I trust vaccines, and I trust the scientists, but I don't trust Donald Trump <U+0097> this is what I meant: https://t.co/oBDXcFUAek. We can<U+0092>t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit.

Any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period. https://t.co/Ecu9jPrcHL. We all want a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, but it needs to be based on science <U+0097> not politics. Tune in as I discuss how we can develop and equitably distribute a safe and effective vaccine: https://t.co/KPxTaqAiVd. We<U+0092>ve lost nearly 200,000 Americans to COVID-19. 

It didn<U+0092>t have to be this bad <U+0097> but Donald Trump failed to do his job.. The fact of the matter is Donald Trump doesn't have a health care plan.

I do <U+0097> and you can read it here: https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT https://t.co/LbvDvFj4m8. Donald Trump<U+0092>s climate denial may not have directly caused the record fires we<U+0092>re seeing on the West Coast. But if he gets four more years in the White House, they<U+0092>ll only become more common, devastating, and deadly. https://t.co/7rsG9VDZ4w. To be clear: I am not currently president. But if you chip in now, we can change that in November: https://t.co/eFS4tDfHEx https://t.co/ciqFcIGLHB. Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of the strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots. No matter where your family came from, we're here because we all share the same ideals. That's the story of America <U+0097> and it is well worth celebrating. https://t.co/rign44stJc. Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico <U+0097> but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. It's unacceptable.

As president, I'll support the island's full recovery and invest in its people and future.. Today marks the official start of Hispanic Heritage Month. Tune in as we kick off our celebration from Florida: https://t.co/GMSo25KzM6. As we celebrate the Independence Day of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, we must affirm the democratic aspirations and human rights of people across Latin America.

I'll always fight for democracy and for those who come to America seeking a better life.. The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing is a powerful reminder of our past and what remains at stake in this election. As we honor the memory of those four little girls, we must commit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse 57 years ago.. I believe that every American deserves a fair shot to get ahead and a government that treats them equally. But that hasn't been the case for the people of Puerto Rico. Today, I'm releasing my new plan to change that: https://t.co/qX7sQPPfmX. For months, President Trump has failed to provide desperately needed fiscal relief to our state and local governments <U+0097> and we<U+0092>re seeing the consequences every day.

Our students and educators deserve better.

As president, I<U+0092>ll make sure they always have the resources they need. https://t.co/E2jaIFPkzC. The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by those who defend our nation at war. I<U+0092>m in Tampa, Florida, to hear from veterans and to discuss how I<U+0092>ll honor that promise as president. Tune in: https://t.co/SkJOytj8gm. Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for his failed response and for lying to the American people. https://t.co/cWuEoHiUxj. This morning, parents all across the West <U+0097> already worried about their kids being indoors because of COVID-19 <U+0097> are now also waking up worried about their kids being outside.

We need a president who takes climate change seriously.. The fact is, Iran is closer to a nuclear bomb today than it was when Donald Trump took office.

Every day he<U+0092>s in charge of our national security is another day our enemies are emboldened and the American people are at risk. https://t.co/hEMkpGARuo. When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks <U+0093>hoax.<U+0094> 

I think <U+0093>jobs.<U+0094>

Good paying, union jobs that put Americans to work building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation. https://t.co/AKl9jZKB0s. .@realDonaldTrump, you know what<U+0092>s actually threatening our suburbs?

Wildfires. Floods. Hurricanes.

We need to act on climate. Now.. Folks, it all comes down to this. We have just 50 days until the most important election of our lifetimes.

Make a plan to have your voice heard this November. https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M. Amy Poehler and @MayaRudolph know a thing or two about @HillaryClinton and @KamalaHarris <U+0097> and I can't wait to see what they have in store for tonight's grassroots fundraiser.

Chip in now to reserve your ticket: https://t.co/EUe06GBv9U https://t.co/fDavPo1Fuo. Climate change is the existential challenge that will define our future as a country. Tune in as I discuss the wildfires up and down the West Coast <U+0097> and how I'll tackle the climate crisis head-on and create millions of good-paying jobs: https://t.co/yMhodX8RYe. 50 days until Election Day. 50 days to do everything we can to make Donald Trump a one-term president.

Chip in to power our campaign through this final stretch: https://t.co/6WkyWFXVpc. Weapons of war have no place in our communities.

We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.. I know we can beat Donald Trump and build this nation back better <U+0097> but we need your help to do it. That's why we're launching our new Grassroots Fundraising Team.

Sign up and help us win this November. https://t.co/T5CN04xsXo. I promise that as president, I<U+0092>ll make reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act a top priority and continue working to end gender-based violence. https://t.co/wmN7bSAUVg. With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger.

The latest bill<U+0097>passed by the House last year<U+0097>would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women.

But Mitch McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. It<U+0092>s despicable.. 26 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. In the years since, it has saved countless lives and helped change the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence.

Writing and championing the law remains one of my proudest accomplishments. https://t.co/9pV7X9fgKq. It's hard to believe, but Monday marks 50 days until Election Day. To kick off the final stretch, @HillaryClinton and @KamalaHarris are hosting a grassroots fundraiser.

You won't want to miss this, folks. Chip in to reserve your spot: https://t.co/WI4clZqxEA. 26 years ago today, the Senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines<U+0097>it was an effort I was proud to champion.

These bans saved lives, and Congress should have never let them expire.

As president, I<U+0092>ll take on the @NRA and we<U+0092>ll ban them once again.. This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.

Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.

Jill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery. https://t.co/330QfeIUGg. In a Biden-Harris administration, <U+0093>Buy American<U+0094> will be more than a slogan. 

We<U+0092>re going to invest an additional $400 billion in purchasing American-made products and keep good-paying jobs here at home. https://t.co/HrOOkXerMP. Donald Trump and I have pretty different philosophies when it comes to giving our word.
 
Mine means something.
 
When I tell the American people I<U+0092>m going to do something <U+0097> I follow through. https://t.co/FCHpIGHtf2. I promise you that if I<U+0092>m elected president, I<U+0092>ll never forget what the job is about. It<U+0092>s about you <U+0097> the American people. https://t.co/ACGjYymWSg. Iran<U+0092>s cruel execution of Navid Afkari is a travesty. No country should arrest, torture, or execute peaceful protestors or activists. 

Iran must free its other political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, and release unjustly detained Americans. https://t.co/Jj9QZbyQL7. As president, I<U+0092>ll impose a tax penalty on companies that ship jobs overseas and sell products back to the U.S. <U+0097> and I<U+0092>ll create millions of good-paying jobs here at home.

We<U+0092>re going to make sure the future is made in America <U+0097> by all of America's workers. https://t.co/8smOm5MGx1. The science is clear, and deadly signs like the fires out West are unmistakable <U+0097> climate change poses an existential threat to our way of life.

We must act now to avoid a future defined by tragedies like the one American families are enduring today. https://t.co/iGNTQVOy3t. You deserve a President and Vice President who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better.

I promise that<U+0092>s exactly what @KamalaHarris and I will do.. And now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation <U+0097> so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.. Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service.. This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss <U+0097> a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans.. Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of Americans in every corner of the country. https://t.co/6rAF0dAd1Y. As a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders. Though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of Americans recovered as it always does <U+0097> unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it. https://t.co/Ogn7Sbvq1Q. Donald Trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. We didn't need a cheerleader. We needed a president.. More than 1,000 people died from COVID yesterday.

@realDonaldTrump watched eight hours of TV.

If I<U+0092>m president, you might not always agree with me. But I promise you I will always show up and fight for you. https://t.co/HvVJLS83TZ. Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today<U+0097>while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard.

These are frontline workers against COVID-19, responsible for testing and distributing food and medical supplies.

Michiganders need a pandemic response<U+0097>not a pep rally. https://t.co/UkEqVv9zXe. Make no mistake: Climate change is already here <U+0097> and we<U+0092>re witnessing its devastating effects every single day. 

We have to get President Trump out of the White House and treat this crisis like the existential threat that it is. https://t.co/NXzkpaRVsY. To everyone struggling right now, I want you to know that you are not alone. You<U+0092>re seen, you<U+0092>re heard, and you<U+0092>re loved. 

If you need help, please don<U+0092>t hesitate to visit https://t.co/tPKtlFFCIY. 

Better days lie ahead, I promise. #WorldSuicidePreventionDay. The images coming out of California, Oregon, Washington, and other Western states are truly horrifying. If you<U+0092>re in an impacted area, please heed the warnings from your local authorities and stay safe. Jill and I are keeping you all in our prayers. https://t.co/39vcORJEBX. Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.. I got to meet Lou Brock back in March. I joked that I had really just come to St. Louis to see him<U+0097>and let me tell you, our meeting was a real highlight. Lou was a true legend and a man of integrity. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers during this difficult time. https://t.co/ZStoBAnk7V. Donald Trump knew that COVID-19 was dangerous. He knew it was deadly. And he purposely downplayed it.

Now, nearly 200,000 Americans are dead.

It<U+0092>s unconscionable. https://t.co/SLqqhmWy8E. If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. 

Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action <U+0097> costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.

It<U+0092>s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.. Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him.

I may be a Phillies fan, but I<U+0092>m always proud to honor the legacy of #21. https://t.co/ZWSfIBUD0p. I promise you that if I<U+0092>m elected, I<U+0092>ll always tell you the truth.

I<U+0092>ll listen to the experts and do everything I can to contain this virus.

And I<U+0092>ll always put your health and safety first <U+0097> no matter the political cost.. Donald Trump knew.

He lied to us for months.

And while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job <U+0097> on purpose.

It was a life or death betrayal of the American people. https://t.co/WDmVUvmmJk. I<U+0092>m in Warren, Michigan, to discuss how a Biden-Harris administration will ensure the future is made in America <U+0097> by America<U+0092>s workers. Tune in now: https://t.co/OzJ3Vnc8kd. The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is <U+0097> exercise it. 

Make your voice heard this November. https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk. President Obama and I rescued the auto industry and helped Michigan's economy come roaring back.

Donald Trump squandered it <U+0097> and hardworking Michiganders are paying the price every day. https://t.co/kXjyPbsj8s. Given his track record, no one can take Trump<U+0092>s word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine. But with satisfactory answers to these questions, every American can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. https://t.co/074K1HD9wf. 3: What is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to Americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics?
 
President Trump should release a detailed distribution plan to ensure every American <U+0097> not just the wealthy and well-connected <U+0097> receives the vaccine.. 2: Who will validate that the Administration<U+0092>s decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation?
 
We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from @FDACBER, the @US_FDA vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci.. 1: What criteria will be used to ensure a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy?

The FDA must clarify what criteria it will use, and President Trump must commit to respecting the independent judgment of the non-political professional staff at the FDA.. A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible.

But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool.

Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:. Every single American worker deserves the chance to join a union. As president, I<U+0092>ll strengthen our labor unions and ensure workers can bargain for the pay, benefits, and workplace protections they deserve. https://t.co/Yqd8D5SzbQ. Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida.
 
Now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. Unbelievable.
 
You don't have to guess where I stand: I oppose new offshore drilling. https://t.co/oxfQNIymBh. On this feast day of Cuba<U+0092>s patron saint la Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Jill and I pray that the love and compassion <U+0093>Cachita<U+0094> inspires will fill the hearts of Cubans and believers around the world. https://t.co/Vn1FoFV4Uo. Unlike Donald Trump, I'll listen to the experts and heed their advice <U+0097> especially when it comes to matters of health and safety.

You should expect nothing less from your president. https://t.co/RwF1BQtJAh. This economy may be working great for Donald Trump and his wealthy friends <U+0097> but it's not working for the rest of America.

It's time we change that.. At our best, America has always been generous, kind, and optimistic. We treat each other with dignity, give hate no safe harbor, and leave no one behind.

I believe we can be that nation once again.. Mr. President <U+0097> If you<U+0092>re so good at making deals, then why does your trade deal cost American workers so much pain while letting China off the hook for its biggest trade abuses? https://t.co/mL8a67CTAw. As president, I<U+0092>ll make record investments in American industry and create millions of good-paying, union jobs.

We<U+0092>re going to make sure the future is made in America <U+0097> and built by union workers. https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0. Wall Street didn't build this country <U+0097> the middle class did. And unions built the middle class.

Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does.. It's not enough to just thank our essential workers <U+0097> we need to pay them. As president, I<U+0092>ll:

- Raise the minimum wage to $15
- End the tipped minimum wage
- End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities
- Ensure everyone has strong benefits. For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions. 

It will end on my watch.

I'll sign the PRO Act <U+0097> making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain <U+0097> and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.. Together, we can build a future that reflects working people<U+0092>s courage and ambition. One that not only offers good jobs <U+0097> but the dignity, equity, shared prosperity, and common purpose due to every American. https://t.co/FDLGMKCgWD. The 40-hour workweek
Minimum wage
Overtime pay
Health care 
Workplace safety protections

They<U+0092>re all because of unions <U+0097> and it<U+0092>s time we recognize that.. Today, we honor the generations of union workers who fought for the rights, power, wages, and benefits that built and sustained the great American middle class. #LaborDay https://t.co/gTqE9tYUKd. Time and again, the president has refused to provide Puerto Rico with much-needed resources. He<U+0092>s repeatedly insulted Puerto Ricans and this latest action is another example of his disrespect for the island. 

This ends when I<U+0092>m elected president. https://t.co/FitVSFl8bS. Donald Trump promised to be ""the greatest jobs president God ever created.""

But in reality, he's on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered.

American workers can't take four more years of his failed leadership.. We all want our schools to reopen <U+0097> but we need to do it in a way that puts the health and safety of our students and educators first.

Here's how @KamalaHarris and I will reopen our schools safely and effectively: https://t.co/yJswM3PliF. The economy wasn<U+0092>t working for folks long before this virus hit. That<U+0092>s why @KamalaHarris and I won<U+0092>t just build back to the way things were <U+0097> we<U+0092>re going to build back better.

We<U+0092>re going to make sure everyone has a fair shot to get ahead. https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0. As president, I will:

- Call for nationwide mask mandates
- Implement widespread testing
- Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines

I<U+0092>m ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track.. Nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing oppression deserve to have their cases heard. Instead, they<U+0092>re being deported back into the tyrannical grip of Daniel Ortega without a chance to pursue their claims.

President Trump<U+0092>s cruelty truly knows no bounds. https://t.co/FxhjCUXkZ8. Mr. President, enough with the weekend golf trips and erratic tweets. It's time for you to get to work and control the spread of this virus. https://t.co/SfsEQMgc5z. Every day Donald Trump proves how morally unfit he is to lead our nation.

In 60 days, we have to vote him out. https://t.co/EteeruIOm6. Now is not the time for a victory lap, Mr. President. Just because your wealthy friends and donors are doing well doesn't mean everyone else is.

Get off the golf course. Call the leaders of Congress to the White House. And make a deal that delivers for working people.. The fact is we're more than six months into this pandemic, and:

- 11.5 million Americans don't have their jobs back
- Almost 30 million are on unemployment
- We're down 720,000 manufacturing jobs
- Nearly 1 in 6 small businesses have closed their doors. I'm grateful for everyone who found work in August and found that glimmer of hope <U+0097> but there is real cause for concern in this morning's jobs report.

The pace of job gains in August was slower than in July. And significantly slower than May or June.. Tune in as I discuss how our economic crisis has been worsened by President Trump's failure to get COVID-19 under control: https://t.co/YeDBBOntHe. Here<U+0092>s my promise to you: If I have the honor of serving as the next commander in chief, I will ensure that our American heroes know that I will have their back and honor their sacrifice. Always. https://t.co/wMFHHscD51. In 2016, President Trump promised to reduce the trade deficit and said: ""You will see a drop like you've never seen before.""

The reality? It's the highest it's been in 12 years.

American workers can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. https://t.co/3CGY4Hym8o. Folks, today marks two months until Election Day. That means we have just two months to do everything we can to beat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation.

Chip in to help us win in November: https://t.co/UjC7yoIpU4. This is our moment to root out systemic racism and ensure justice finally rings out for all in America. https://t.co/mXzAZ9VZfR. We need a president who will work to lower the temperature <U+0097> not raise it. A president who will bring people together and find solutions to the challenges we face.

That's what I went to Kenosha to do today, and it's what I'll do every day in the White House. https://t.co/dNenwVZjUg. It<U+0092>s time we come together as a nation to heal and address the challenges we face. Tune in to our community conversation in Kenosha, Wisconsin: https://t.co/5Vda70tPCu. Right now, classrooms should be humming with excitement for a new year and students<U+0092> hopes for their futures.

Instead, many are silent and empty because President Trump didn<U+0092>t do his job.

America<U+0092>s families are paying the price for his failures.. I've always believed we're at our best when we act as one America. It's time for us to come together, propel our nation across this turbulent threshold, and build a better future for all.. Time and time again, President Trump has refused to stand up to Putin. His silence on the poisoning of Mr. Navalny is just the latest example.

As president, I'll do what Trump won't: hold the Putin regime accountable for its crimes. https://t.co/z11YyV6lq0. They're rooting for chaos and violence because they think it helps them win a second term.

Now ask yourself, is that really who you think should be running the country? https://t.co/rXf0O5u0WC. We<U+0092>re just over two months from Election Day. But in many states, you don<U+0092>t have to wait until November to make your voice heard.

Head to https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M and make a plan to vote early today.. Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos are the worst possible people to lead our nation<U+0092>s schools through this pandemic.. We all want students back in the classroom, but President Trump hasn't done the work to make sure schools can reopen safely and effectively.

@KamalaHarris and I will be ready on day 1 with a roadmap for reopening. https://t.co/yJswM3PliF. President Trump has failed to address COVID-19 <U+0097> and now our students and educators are paying the price. Tune in as I discuss my plan to safely and effectively reopen schools: https://t.co/ntofl4zV7v. This campaign is powered by grassroots supporters like you <U+0097> and every dollar counts to close the fundraising gap with the Trump campaign. $5, $10, $15, whatever you can, chip in today: https://t.co/pHQWesk2AR. Last month we raised $364.5 million <U+0097> 95% of the donations from grassroots supporters like you and the majority online.

Working people are powering our campaign <U+0097> and I<U+0092>m grateful.

We<U+0092>ve got a long way to go to close the fundraising gap and win <U+0097> but we can do it. Together.. Donald Trump is determined to instill fear and divide us, but what he doesn't understand is that fear never builds the future <U+0097> hope does. https://t.co/3DFE6R6CWQ. For far too long, discriminatory policies like redlining have kept Black Americans from having the same opportunities as white Americans.

That<U+0092>s got to change: https://t.co/ycM5gKCGyV https://t.co/mmb0u5kqZq. If I<U+0092>m elected president, I promise you that America will be better prepared to deal with any threats that come our way.

That starts with restoring the PREDICT program that President Trump ended. https://t.co/7jDkOaLc8P. .@DrBiden and I send our best wishes to members of the Jain faith concluding the holy observance of Paryushan and Das Lakshan. May we all find peace and reconciliation in our lives. Michhami Dukkaddam and Kshamavani!. We need a president who will lower the temperature and bring the country together <U+0097> not one who raises it and tears us further apart. https://t.co/e6aFLx9iqU. Our nation is at an inflection point. @KamalaHarris and I sat down to discuss what brought us to this moment <U+0097> and how we move forward and build back better than before. Tune in to watch: https://t.co/PlmeffTySN. Across the country, people rely on public transportation to get to work, see loved ones, and access essential services. But that's all under threat because Republicans refuse to do their jobs.

Congress must act now to save public transit.. Today<U+0092>s press conference made it clear: we are all less safe because Donald Trump has failed at his job.

We need a President who will stop violence <U+0097> not incite it. https://t.co/AhGNZCDQkr. President Shri Pranab Mukherjee was a devout public servant who believed deeply in the importance of our two nations tackling global challenges together. Jill and I are saddened to hear of his passing <U+0097> our prayers go out to his loved ones and the Indian people. https://t.co/SJfaDEKjGi. I urge President Trump to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is an important right <U+0097> violence is wrong. Period.

If he can<U+0092>t say that, then he is unfit to be President. https://t.co/W4sjpF0Z3V. Tonight, President Trump declined to rebuke violence.

He wouldn<U+0092>t even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder.

He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it.. Donald Trump looks at this violence and sees a political lifeline.

He failed to protect America, so now he's trying to scare America. https://t.co/BCoO4gS2zE. Folks, we're just hours away from our first end-of-month fundraising deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal and show Donald Trump we have what it takes to win in November.

If you're able, please chip in today: https://t.co/8tOxeZGUM9. Anyone who met Amari will tell you that he was a charismatic young man<U+0097>poised for greatness. He was ready and willing to take on the world. I can tell you that in 20 years, we all would have been saying, <U+0091>Amari for President.<U+0092> #AmariForPresident https://t.co/aa01lftpzt. More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.

Nearly one in six small businesses in this country are closed.

Do you really feel safer under Trump?. Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe.

Well, he is president <U+0097> whether he knows it or not.. Trump and Pence are running on this: <U+0093>You won<U+0092>t be safe in Joe Biden<U+0092>s America.<U+0094>

And what<U+0092>s their proof?

The violence you<U+0092>re seeing in Donald Trump<U+0092>s America.. I want a safe America <U+0097> safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. 

And let<U+0092>s be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump.. Donald Trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is.. Donald Trump can<U+0092>t stop the violence we're seeing today <U+0096> because for years he has fomented it.  Tune in as I discuss the need for justice and safety in America: https://t.co/gSXuP0jc5D. We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump:
 
COVID.
Economic devastation.
Unwarranted police violence.
Emboldened white nationalists.
A reckoning on race.
Declining faith in a bright American future.

The common thread? A president who makes things worse <U+0097> not better.. We<U+0092>re going to build back better and we will do it while creating a brighter future for you and your families. This week @KamalaHarris and I sit down to discuss how we are going to move forward<U+0097>together.

Join us on Tuesday. https://t.co/hebSifEEHL. There<U+0092>s a lot happening, but I hope we don<U+0092>t overlook the brave fire fighters &amp; emergency responders in the wake of Hurricane Laura.

When the storm hit, they stayed behind<U+0097>even while their homes were being destroyed<U+0097>to help their community recover.

True American heroes.. This video is doctored <U+0097> and a flagrant attempt to spread misinformation at the expense of a man who uses assistive technology. 

It should be removed. Now. https://t.co/Bnv5H2NhZT. I<U+0092>m thrilled to announce our grassroots fundraiser with our friends. I hope you<U+0092>ll join @DrBiden, @JVN, @Karamo, @TanFrance, @Antoni, and @BobbyBerk this Tuesday.

Chip in to reserve your spot: https://t.co/WV2DfZxixR https://t.co/QmsevDhVSb. Donald Trump has been president for almost four years.

The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper.

And all of us are less safe because he can<U+0092>t do the job of the American president.. We must not become a country at war with ourselves.

A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another.

But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.. The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable.

I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same. https://t.co/JRuI7ya2Wv. We run this campaign led by the values that guide my life - honesty, integrity, and compassion. @KamalaHarris and I are hard at work and want to let you into the conversation.

Join us this Tuesday. https://t.co/zu0QDka23i. No lies, fear-mongering, or malarkey.

Just an honest conversation about the future of our nation.

Tune in this Tuesday. https://t.co/yWc0ewazL4. I believe we're so much better than what we saw this week at the RNC.

This is our moment to choose love over hate, hope over fear, fact over fiction.

We'll overcome this era of American darkness, together. https://t.co/QEMvt14wG8. I don<U+0092>t know a single person who believes any part of this pandemic has been a <U+0093>good thing"".

Secretary DeVos and President Trump refuse to take this virus seriously<U+0097>our children are paying the price.

https://t.co/VYxH7JyWtM. I believe there's not a single thing the American people can't accomplish if we do it together. We're going to overcome these crises and emerge stronger than before.. Folks, we<U+0092>re just a few days away from our biggest end-of-month deadline yet and we need your help to hit our goal. Every donation <U+0097> big or small <U+0097> makes a big difference.

Please chip in today: https://t.co/fobkAUPc7P. The true power of @ChadwickBoseman was bigger than anything we saw on screen. From the Black Panther to Jackie Robinson, he inspired generations and showed them they can be anything they want <U+0097> even super heroes. Jill and I are praying for his loved ones at this difficult time.. America was built on a simple idea: All men <U+0097> and women <U+0097> are created equal. 

It<U+0092>s time we ensured all people are treated equally as well.. The President incites violence, inspires white-supremacist shooters, and his failed COVID response is costing thousands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask yourself: Do you feel safe in Trump<U+0092>s America? https://t.co/Ztp6TdSwKk. America is at an inflection point.

The calls for racial justice that sparked the March on Washington 57 years ago are ringing out again today.

As we honor the legacy of that day <U+0097> let's meet this moment with the urgency and action that our heroes marched for half a century ago. https://t.co/Bs0SccjnxN. I know from personal experience how important access to quality, affordable health care is for a family. I know the peace of mind it brings.

It's why as president, I promise I'll protect your children's health care as if they were my own. https://t.co/kqiKt8ISXj. As we mark the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, we must continue the hard work of perfecting our union. It's up to all of us to carry on the march toward equality, liberty, and justice for all.. I am grateful for your friendship and leadership, @AbeShinzo. I<U+0092>m sad to see you step down, but I know the strong alliance between our countries and peoples will continue for generations to come. Wishing you good health in the years ahead, my friend. https://t.co/M0cMT5y9Dd. Mr. President, Americans are canceling weddings and holding funerals without family. They're sacrificing so more Americans don't have to die.

But instead of leading by example, you hosted a super spreader event on the South Lawn.

When will you take the presidency seriously? https://t.co/DcVUGsZ9a5. We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags.

This is a moment of action.

It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer.. Times of crisis often bring out our best as Americans <U+0097> and we're seeing that right now in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura. Thank you to all of our emergency responders who are working around the clock to help people get back on their feet. https://t.co/uwhq4dDgwO. Tonight is yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election. 

Who we are, what we stand for, and who we want to be <U+0097> it's all on the ballot this November.

We have to beat Donald Trump. Chip in to help us do it: https://t.co/dWIpEPQcqQ. Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency.. From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.

Now, we<U+0092>re paying the price.. Donald Trump promised to be the greatest jobs president God ever created.

Instead, tens of millions of Americans are out of work and we're facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. #PromisesBroken https://t.co/JzjZu7KKRr. Donald Trump is right, this is the most important election in the history of our country.

Chip in to help us get him out of the White House: https://t.co/1Ve0clLACI. Donald Trump calls himself a wartime president. But now, instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he<U+0092>s waved the white flag.

He abandoned the American people when we needed him most.. When President Trump took office, he inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And just like everything else he<U+0092>s inherited in his life, he squandered it. https://t.co/tTBD8lRC1c. - 180,000 lives lost
- Nearly 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19
- Over 25 million Americans out of work
- Countless small businesses on the brink of closing

That's Donald Trump's America. We're living it every day. We can't take four more years.. When Donald Trump says tonight you won<U+0092>t be safe in Joe Biden<U+0092>s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump<U+0092>s America?. This news is deeply disturbing <U+0097> as an alum of @UDelaware and as an American. We need a full and swift investigation into what happened Tuesday night.
 
With anti-Semitism on the rise across the country, we all have a moral obligation to speak out and give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/YofvhFv6wA. President Trump doesn<U+0092>t want a second term. He wants a do-over.

As he takes the stage tonight, remember: he alone is responsible for the chaos in our country.

Together, we can stop it. https://t.co/iKcrLuEC9N. Donald Trump and Republicans must have forgotten about the 180,000 American lives lost due to COVID-19.

I promise you that, as president, I never will. https://t.co/wcsLLmvB2n. I couldn't be more ready for @KamalaHarris to be the next Vice President.

Chip in to help us make history: https://t.co/UzTdwLgkeM. Last night, Vice President Mike Pence stood before America and with a straight face said, <U+0093>You won<U+0092>t be safe in Joe Biden<U+0092>s America.<U+0094>

His proof?

The violence you<U+0092>re seeing in Donald Trump<U+0092>s America. https://t.co/4xx9Mj4bfZ. Tune in as @KamalaHarris discusses President Trump<U+0092>s failure to lead on COVID-19 and what a Biden-Harris administration will do differently: https://t.co/XzT7AUrG3q. The cruelty of this president truly knows no bounds. We can<U+0092>t let him gut Social Security and eliminate funding for disability benefits. https://t.co/QmIMhZfLZn. To lead America, you have to understand America.

I know how hard it is for folks who are sick, struggling, and wondering how they'll get through the day.

You deserve a president who will fight for you and lead our nation out of these crises. I'll get started on day one. https://t.co/evrWlwqhh1. Jill and I are praying for the safety of those in the path of Hurricane Laura. If you are in an impacted area, please heed the advice of local officials. https://t.co/HsSxMKuVpL. The contrast tonight couldn't be clearer:

We can choose four more years of fear, division, and hate.

Or we can choose a different path <U+0097> one of hope, unity, and light.

Let's overcome this era of darkness, together: https://t.co/agUqzkqkXT. 180,000 people have died from this COVID crisis. And the heartbreaking truth is that it didn't have to happen this way.. This moment demands moral leadership. And these players answered by standing up, speaking out, and using their platform for good.

Now is not the time for silence. https://t.co/hF3dIb7Hde. 100 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was certified, giving some women the right to vote.

But we still have further to go.

We must carry forward the banner of equality and create that more perfect union we've always strived to be. #WomensEqualityDay https://t.co/v46l5SyLJe. As we celebrate #WomensEqualityDay and the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, we have got to renew our efforts to protect the sacred right to vote.

Every eligible American should be able to make their voice heard at the ballot box. Period.. Amari was 16, not old enough to vote, but that didn't stop him from helping change the course of history. He brought his infectious passion and light to our campaign every day <U+0097> and made us all better in the process. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers. https://t.co/3zHUkWXn9i. Once again, a Black man <U+0097> Jacob Blake <U+0097> was shot by the police. In front of his children. It makes me sick.

Is this the country we want to be?

Needless violence won<U+0092>t heal us. We need to end the violence <U+0097> and peacefully come together to demand justice. https://t.co/WdNqrxA3PK. I know how to lead this nation through a crisis because I've done it before. I won't waste any time getting this virus under control and building our country back better. https://t.co/HgBdR6VxUO. President Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is Maine's hardworking lobstermen and women are hurting under his watch.

They deserve better. And as President, I will work to protect the livelihood and safety of the fishing community. https://t.co/JuF1O2P3EH. I promise you that as president, I will protect America. I will protect you and your family. I will defend our nation from threats seen and unseen.

It's the least of what we should expect from an American president.. I believe the American people are ready for something better. This is our moment to prove hope is more powerful than fear, love is more powerful than hate, and light is more powerful than darkness.

We can't let up until November. https://t.co/sdFA92hfcB. It's time for us, for We the People, to come together.

Because united, we can <U+0097> and will <U+0097> overcome this season of darkness in America. https://t.co/vbZ3JRQU84. Two years ago, we lost a genuine American hero, and to me, a true friend. John McCain never stopped pushing me and our nation to be better. I miss him dearly. https://t.co/0xzoqjDFlP. Together, united in our love for America and each other, we<U+0092>ll overcome this season of darkness and restore the soul of our nation. https://t.co/9dPuQVa3CQ. This moment is bigger than any one political party. We've got to come together as Americans to save our democracy and restore the soul of our nation. Thank you, Senator @JeffFlake. https://t.co/3cAnE1yf0J. Yesterday, Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by police. His kids watched from the car. Today, we woke to grieve yet again.

We need a full and transparent investigation. https://t.co/9X7l25nq8d. President Obama and I established a White House office to prepare our nation for future pandemics. Donald Trump eliminated it <U+0097> and we've been paying the price every single day.. As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that's ruined so many lives.
 
Because I understand something this president doesn't. 
 
We will never get our economy back on track until we deal with this virus.. .@DrBiden and I are keeping everyone in the path of storms Laura and Marco in our prayers. Please take steps to prepare, heed the warnings of local authorities, and stay safe. https://t.co/nXl5j4iewe. America is at an inflection point. 

We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided.

Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light.. 31 years after they joined hands to demand freedom from Soviet oppression, citizens of the Baltic states formed a human chain in solidarity with Belarusians fighting to throw off the chains of dictatorship.

We stand with the people of Belarus as we stood with the Baltic nations. https://t.co/i1wVnU0wkZ. I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I will be an ally of the light, not of the darkness.. If I'm elected, I promise I'll work as hard for those who didn't support me as I will for those who did. https://t.co/s4WIuSfLRL. We can be the generation that finally wipes out the stain of racism from our national character. I believe the American people are up to it. https://t.co/h4qNoQPmDp. Love is more powerful than hate. 

Hope is more powerful than fear. 

Light is more powerful than darkness.  

This is our moment. This is our mission.. It will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America <U+0097> for everyone. That<U+0092>s my commitment to you. https://t.co/UTclDfd8Jm. America is a nation of immigrants. Each new generation that comes to our country makes us stronger. That became even truer yesterday when @luisanaperezf, part of our campaign team in Florida, became a U.S. citizen.

Thanks for choosing us, Luisana. https://t.co/K842eGj5tK. To everyone celebrating the Hindu festival of Ganesh Chaturthi in the U.S., India, and around the world, may you overcome all obstacles, be blessed with wisdom, and find a path toward new beginnings.. I have always believed you can define America in one word: Possibilities. 
 
In America, everyone should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.. Together, we can and will rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back <U+0097> we'll build it back better. https://t.co/ieky2t09KE. .@DrBiden and I are keeping all those affected by the wildfires in California in our prayers. Please heed the warnings from local officials and stay safe. https://t.co/F9QaGQIbcV. Brayden <U+0097> When I was growing up, my mom always told me that bravery resides in every heart and that someday it will be summoned. Well, you summoned yours last night and showed the whole world that your stutter doesn't define you. I couldn't be prouder. https://t.co/61eAOjraHq. Folks, it's been a big week. To celebrate, and to help elect Democrats up-and-down the ballot, @KamalaHarris, @DrBiden, @DouglasEmhoff and I are hosting a grassroots fundraiser.

We'd love to see you there. Chip in to join us: https://t.co/j21aLLRH7H https://t.co/caN5dsqBeg. I give you my word: if you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us instead of the worst. I will be an ally of the light instead of the darkness, and we will once again be united in our love for America and for each other.

Join us: https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju https://t.co/OBaF3qRu24. Donald Trump continues to cozy up to Russia while Putin persecutes civil society and journalists. 

Now, opposition leader Alexei Navalny is in a coma after being poisoned. It's unacceptable. 

Unlike Trump, I'll defend our democratic values and stand up to autocrats like Putin. https://t.co/OLjoGDaG4f. You placed your faith in our campaign and I can<U+0092>t thank you enough. I<U+0092>m grateful for your support and honored to be the Democratic nominee.

With 75 days left, we<U+0092>ve got to get to work. Chip in to help us win: https://t.co/Kkref2smgA. May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here, tonight as love and hope and light joined the battle for the soul of the nation. https://t.co/Pdk8c75ATr. Character is on the ballot. Compassion is on the ballot. Decency, science, democracy.

They are all on the ballot. https://t.co/eRVvX6eD2M. This campaign isn't just about winning votes. 

It's about winning the heart, and yes, the soul of America. https://t.co/0wpuAEUzum. Our president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation. 

He failed to protect us.
He failed to protect America.
And that is unforgivable.. Who we are as a nation, what we stand for, and who we want to be <U+0097> that's on the ballot this November.. It is with great honor and humility that I accept this nomination for President of the United States of America.. .@StephenCurry30 and @ayeshacurry: Thank you for your support. When I<U+0092>m president, you and your family are welcome at the White House any time.

And, Riley and Ryan, the Vice President will be @KamalaHarris. I think you<U+0092>ll really like her. #DemConvention https://t.co/0sueYneJF4. Beau is with me every single day. If he was here tonight, he would remind me <U+0091>just be who you are.<U+0092> I<U+0092>m a better person because of him. #DemConvention https://t.co/MMP6gCDeJS. John Lewis was a dear friend. He was the best of who we are and what we can become. And he held onto the promise of this country until his final breath. We miss you, John. #DemConvention https://t.co/fRAr5Mijst. We<U+0092>ve been tested. This is a critical moment. Tonight, we<U+0092>ll take the next step to restore leadership to this country and the White House.   Watch live: https://t.co/ASV0vXUeQi. I<U+0092>m inspired to see folks from across the country coming together for the #DemConvention.

I first ran for Senate when I was 29 years old, and I<U+0092>m as optimistic about our future now as I was then. 

It<U+0092>s time to set our nation on a new path. One where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone has a fair shot to get ahead.. Folks, it's the final night of the #DemConvention and @TeamJoe is hosting an after party that you won't want to miss.

Sign up to join us: https://t.co/GfzjO7Rx6J. The story of this campaign has had its ups and downs, but through its course we<U+0092>ve brought our party and nation together. Now, it<U+0092>s time for the final chapter.

Let<U+0092>s do this. https://t.co/FDEszl2lpD. From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President <U+0097> I<U+0092>ve dedicated my entire life to serving this country, and I<U+0092>m not done yet. https://t.co/1Ojc7u7dS0. Tonight, I'll officially accept the nomination to be President of the United States of America. Before my speech, join us for a Grassroots Fest featuring James Taylor and Doug Emhoff.

Chip in now to reserve your spot: https://t.co/Vxch9xBxz7 https://t.co/xG4JRePFDE. When I first launched my campaign, I said we're in a battle for the soul of this nation.
 
As I accept the nomination tonight, it's clear what's at stake in the next 75 days.
 
We can and will win. Join us in the fight: https://t.co/vegxIzIAkN. Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19 <U+0097> but he does bear full responsibility for the failed national response. 

We've got to hold him accountable this November.. Last night we made history when we nominated @KamalaHarris to be the next Vice President. 

Watch the highlights from night three of the #DemConvention: https://t.co/YMLN65lVRV. .@BarackObama led our nation back from the brink of economic collapse. He rallied the world to take on the scourge of terror and the threat of climate change.
When he tells you that our democracy is on the line this fall: listen. Vote.

https://t.co/MtT1Nu2GVs. I believe there<U+0092>s not a single thing we can<U+0092>t do if we do it together. Chip in to help us build the movement that will beat Donald Trump and put me and @KamalaHarris in the White House. https://t.co/3nXDORqfjB. Kamala Harris will be an incredible Vice President.

Now let<U+0092>s get to work. We don<U+0092>t have a minute to waste.. Hillary: tonight, I<U+0092>m reminded of one of your favorite sayings <U+0097> rooted in the faith we both share: <U+0093>Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.<U+0094>

Thanks for always living by that, and reminding us to do the same.. I authored the Violence Against Women Act, and as president I<U+0092>ll expand our efforts to end gender-based violence. Thank you, @Mariska, @RuthMGlenn, and Carly Dryden for your courage and advocacy. Together, we<U+0092>ll get this done. #DemConvention https://t.co/2bjnlz4s1w. When I hear the words <U+0093>climate change,<U+0094> I hear another word: <U+0093>jobs.<U+0094> We can solve our climate crisis and our economic crisis at the same time. #DemConvention https://t.co/PZQvGM2uTR. I<U+0092>m doing this for Gabby. I<U+0092>m doing this for so many families who have lost a loved one to gun violence. We<U+0092>re going to be on the right side of history. #DemConvention https://t.co/DhTCg1jmbr. I made a promise to families hurt by gun violence to never, ever give up on the fight. Tonight, I make the same promise to you. #DemConvention https://t.co/9dWV7M5vXz. Our nation<U+0092>s gun violence epidemic is really a cowardice problem <U+0097> and there<U+0092>s a lot of politicians in Washington who haven<U+0092>t shown half the courage @emma4change has. I hope they<U+0092>re all paying attention. #DemConvention https://t.co/yZ0xcjB6uG. You heard @KamalaHarris: Your voice is your vote. So get prepared for the election and make a plan for how you<U+0092>ll cast your ballot. #DemConvention https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk. We can<U+0092>t go back to the way things were before these crises, because things weren<U+0092>t working for far too many Americans.  Tonight, we<U+0092>ll discuss our plans to build back better and set this nation on a new path. https://t.co/N35wrjKcPj. When Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the President threw paper towels and abandoned the victims.

Turns out he even wanted to sell the island. He turned his back on Puerto Ricans, but I promise you this: I never will. https://t.co/BESg95vdTi. The truth is, there's not a lot of people whose opinion I valued more than Beau's. When I was deciding who to pick as my running mate, I thought a lot about his friendship with @KamalaHarris and the respect he had for her.

I know he'd be proud of my choice. https://t.co/Lv9E0KgwZG. They say choosing your running mate is the most important decision you make when you<U+0092>re running for president. Well, I<U+0092>m confident I made the right choice.

Tonight, @KamalaHarris speaks directly to America. Tune in at 9 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/0kFuobs91Z. When it comes down to it, Kamala and Doug share the same basic values set that Jill and I do <U+0097> and it all starts with family. It<U+0092>s at the very core of who we are. And it<U+0092>s why I<U+0092>m confident they<U+0092>re the best possible partners for the road ahead. https://t.co/VXkmeyOybY. We have the power to write the future we want for this country <U+0097> and it starts at the ballot box this November.

Register to vote today and let<U+0092>s get to work: https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk https://t.co/os2A8lhMIT. The brave citizens of Belarus are showing their voices will not be silenced by terror or torture. The U.S. should support Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's call for fair elections. Russia must be told not to interfere<U+0097>this is not about geopolitics but the right to choose one's leaders.. I might be a little biased, but I think @DrBiden gave the best speech in convention history last night.

Check it out along with other highlights from night two of the #DemConvention: https://t.co/ZbwPoFYiMw. Tonight made one thing clear: We need to restore real leadership to the White House <U+0097> and we need to do it now. Chip in to help us make it happen. https://t.co/4o4OT4ugJn. Jill loves fiercely, cares deeply, and nothing stops her when she sets her mind to making something right. For all of you across the country, just think of your favorite educator who gave you the confidence to believe in yourself. That<U+0092>s the kind of First Lady Jill will be.. John McCain was a good man, and a good friend. He made this country better. I miss him dearly. #DemConvention https://t.co/TZ4cRY5fz4. Thank you, @AdyBarkan for your courage and for all that you do to ensure a more just, more equal America. #DemConvention https://t.co/JDqhwK719L. It is the honor of my life to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States of America. #DemConvention. Jacquelyn: Your nomination means the world to me. Thank you <U+0097> and I hope you know: we love you back. #DemConvention https://t.co/BDS1HQAxhM. .@SallyQYates is right: This president has done nothing but use his position to benefit himself rather than our country #DemConvention https://t.co/xgTEA2MYWs. I remember helping President Carter with his campaign back when I was a first-term Senator. I'm deeply honored to have his support today.

Thank you, Mr. President. #DemConvention https://t.co/P7deAwTbzo. These young leaders represent not just the next generation, but the diversity of our great nation. #DemConvention https://t.co/bKpUrUbC0K. America is an idea stronger than any army and bigger than any ocean. It<U+0092>s more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It offers hope. #DemConvention https://t.co/93R8wxNzUk. Last night, folks from across the country came together to show how much stronger we are when we stand united.  Looking forward to tonight where we'll talk about why leadership matters, and hear from my favorite #DemConvention speaker, @DrBiden. https://t.co/7nunEqhK9C. We're in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are, what we stand for, and who we want to be <U+0097> it's all at stake. We've got to beat Donald Trump.

Register to vote today to help us do it: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M. Our nation was founded on a simple idea: All men<U+0097>and women<U+0097>are created equal.

We<U+0092>ve never fully lived up to it, but we won<U+0092>t stop trying.

As we mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let<U+0092>s make sure we don<U+0092>t wait another 100 years to fulfill that founding promise.. Donald Trump still doesn<U+0092>t have a plan to get this virus under control. His failure to lead is costing American lives. 

Here<U+0092>s what I<U+0092>ll do as president: https://t.co/etpUGBkONZ https://t.co/aK3GjwG4vw. A good step forward. Yet President Trump continues to do everything he can to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.

I will defend the rights of all Americans to have access to quality, affordable health care, free from discrimination.

https://t.co/zOR0dXH1rt. Tonight we saw that Americans are ready to come together, and that we the people can overcome these crises and emerge stronger than ever. 

Chip in to help us beat Donald Trump and set our nation on a new path. #DemConvention 

https://t.co/mSBDdj70eu. ""If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.""

#DemConvention https://t.co/TDonFz6iHx. ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head...it is what it is.""

#DemConvention https://t.co/OArXv15lVV. ""A president's words have the power to move markets. They can start wars or broker peace. They can summon our better angels or awaken our worst instincts. You simply cannot fake your way through this job.""

#DemConvention https://t.co/ZH1EDg28Al. The leaders who ran in the 2020 primary with me represent the best of America. They made me a better candidate, and they make us a better nation. 

I am proud to have their support. Together, we will defeat Donald Trump. #DemConvention https://t.co/BOztd8iR0b. Governor @GretchenWhitmer <U+0097> thank you for your support and for meeting the COVID-19 crisis with the urgency it demands. The people of Michigan are lucky to have you leading the way. #DemConvention https://t.co/ef2d4DldRV. ""I believe that Americans have more in common than what divides us."" 

I couldn't agree more. What we need to do in both Alabama and Washington is to bring folks together. @DougJones knows that in his core. #DemConvention https://t.co/EIoZDW8ucw. If we want to build back better and deliver real change for the American people, then we've got to flip the U.S. Senate. And the path to doing so runs right through Maine. Thank you, @SaraGideon for being with us tonight. #DemConvention https://t.co/1eyIpC81vC. .@AndrewCuomo, thank you for your leadership and the example you<U+0092>ve set for all Americans during this pandemic. #DemConvention https://t.co/Ir11a1vJQs. George Floyd had a giving spirit. I see that in his family, I see that in his daughter. 

George Floyd should be alive today. #DemConvention https://t.co/hGqZysA5Ng. These last few months have been a wake-up call for our nation. It's up to all of us to do the work to create that more perfect union we've always strived to be. I'm proud of @DemConvention for tonight's powerful conversation on racial justice. #DemConvention https://t.co/Iij5J752xB. ""We are the United States of America. There's not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together."" #DemConvention https://t.co/SLdNN4Oxdv. Thank you @Gwen4Congress and the people of Milwaukee for hosting this year's Democratic National Convention. I wish we could be there to celebrate in person, but I look forward to virtually coming together with folks across the country to make history. #DemConvention. ""We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union""...We the people know what is at stake in this election.

Join me and @TeamJoe for the 48th Democratic National Convention. 

#DemConvention https://t.co/e0zOB9fuFj. People from across the nation are (virtually) coming together for the start of the #DemConvention. Tune in at 9PM ET. https://t.co/TKkhTlKOBC. We<U+0092>re just over an hour away from night one of the @DemConvention. I hope you<U+0092>ll join me and Democrats across the country as we unite around our vision for a better America.

Tune in at 9 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/Gh4ZGgPWXH. Secretary Esper and President Trump, it's a president's job to protect the health and safety of our troops and their families. Gutting the military health care system <U+0097> no less during a global pandemic <U+0097> is unacceptable. https://t.co/lXpcSdm8au. There are only 78 days until Election Day <U+0097> and @KamalaHarris and I need your help to make Donald Trump a one-term president.

Sign up today and let<U+0092>s get to work: https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS. We may be physically apart, but this week Democrats are coming together from across the nation to put forth our vision for a better America. #DemConvention

Tune in tonight at 9 PM ET to join us: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/8pnGC9jrvd. The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were <U+0097> we have to build back better. 

We've got to create an economy that works for everyone <U+0097> not just the wealthy and well-connected.. As Attorney General of the largest state in the country, @KamalaHarris took on the big banks over mortgage fraud, and Big Oil when they wanted to pollute without consequences.

She's the kind of fighter I need alongside me in the White House.. Here<U+0092>s my promise to you: If I<U+0092>m elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide. 

I<U+0092>ll take responsibility instead of blaming others. 

I<U+0092>ll never forget that the job isn<U+0092>t about me <U+0097> it<U+0092>s about you.. Donald Trump and Congress need to act now to deliver the relief the American people need. https://t.co/YhlPXPspcS. The United States of America can be defined by one word: possibilities. There<U+0092>s not a single thing we can<U+0092>t achieve if we set our minds to it. https://t.co/vASpxmaD3E. .@KamalaHarris is smart, tough, and experienced. She knows how to govern and make the hard calls.

She's ready to hit the ground running on day one.. Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert<U+0092>s passing. I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one <U+0097> and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all.. We can meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. We just need a president and vice president ready and willing to lead. https://t.co/HqfHD0qB4y. .@KamalaHarris has spent her entire life fighting for what<U+0092>s right <U+0097> and I know she<U+0092>ll continue that fight when we get to the White House. https://t.co/EgGuiaKKpC. William Perry Pendley has no business working at @blmnational and I'm happy to see his nomination to lead it withdrawn. In a Biden Administration, folks who spend their careers selling off public lands won't get anywhere near being tapped to protect them. https://t.co/a0GsuoCVpn. This was a big week for our campaign: @KamalaHarris joined me on the ticket and we had our best fundraising week yet. Together, we are building the coalition that will beat Donald Trump.

Chip in if you<U+0092>re able to keep the momentum going: https://t.co/MIxfjbChaW. I know a thing or two about being Vice President <U+0097> and I know @KamalaHarris is the best partner I could have for the fight ahead.. Come January, there won<U+0092>t be any time to waste repairing the damage of the last four years and beginning the work of building back better.

@KamalaHarris and I are ready to get to work on day one. https://t.co/xEkEVwTHs6. Donald Trump has had a lot of failures in his career, but he knows how to do one thing well: inherit something great and squander it. And never take any responsibility. https://t.co/mDTSFogeUW. I know just how important Social Security is for countless Americans. That's why as president, I'll protect and strengthen it <U+0097> not defund it.. This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I filled out our paperwork to get on the ballot in November.

Now, we're counting on you to do your part to make sure you're set to vote.

Get registered today: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M https://t.co/JzAonY8TCg. The fate of Social Security is on the ballot in November. As President, I will never, ever defund Social Security. I<U+0092>ll strengthen it.

Anything less is a failure of a president<U+0092>s most important duty: to care for the American people. https://t.co/1GaFbdd6u7. People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis.

The virus isn<U+0092>t taking a break <U+0097> Republicans shouldn<U+0092>t either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back and pass a relief bill. Now.. Voting by mail is safe and secure. And don't take my word for it:
Take it from the President, who just requested his mail-in ballot for the Florida primary on Tuesday.. Today marks 85 years since the Social Security Act was signed into law, providing protection for the most vulnerable. Now we<U+0092>re living in a moment where we must strengthen our commitment to Social Security <U+0097> not defund it.. The choice we make this November will decide the future of America.

I have no doubt @KamalaHarris is the right partner to join me to lead our nation through this moment. https://t.co/YdJFksiCrI. .@KamalaHarris is going to stand with me in this campaign <U+0097> and all of us are going to stand up for her.

Together, we're going to make history. https://t.co/Phw2Le7mrO. There<U+0092>s no better partner than @KamalaHarris to help me beat Donald Trump, but we can<U+0092>t do it without your help.

Chip in today to help us win in November: https://t.co/k2hF0doNMG. The hard truth is Black women still only get paid 62 cents for every dollar white men make. It's unacceptable.

My administration will work to close the pay gap for Black women and create an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay https://t.co/UTADOjULxF. I know @KamalaHarris will work every single day to make life better for all Americans and build this nation back better than before. https://t.co/8hTslszBPC. I first met @KamalaHarris through my son Beau. They grew close while fighting to take on the big banks <U+0097> and he had enormous respect for her and her work.

There is no one<U+0092>s opinion I valued more than Beau<U+0092>s, and I<U+0092>m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.. .@DrBiden and I are keeping the people of Iowa and everyone impacted by Monday's derecho in our prayers. We've got to make sure Iowans and those across the midwest get the relief they need for a quick and full recovery. https://t.co/nsPQUKDbp2. When I was making my decision, I knew I needed someone who<U+0092>s ready to help lead the nation on day one.

@KamalaHarris is that person. https://t.co/7PZUupy8Dm. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And if we're going to get through these crises <U+0097> we need to come together and unite for a better America.

@KamalaHarris gets that <U+0097> and I believe there's no better person to help me get the job done.. When I called @KamalaHarris yesterday to ask her to be my running mate, I wanted to make sure Jill and Doug got to say hello. 

You<U+0092>re honorary Bidens now! https://t.co/IILUjB6WfY. Heather Heyer was a brave young woman who saw what was happening in her hometown of Charlottesville and decided to fight against it. 

Let us honor her memory by continuing to stand against hate.. Three years ago today, white supremacists descended on Charlottesville with torches in hand and hate in their hearts. Our president said they were ""very fine people.""
 
It was clear then, and it's clear now: We are in a battle for the soul of our nation, and we must win.. One of the reasons I chose @KamalaHarris is because we both believe you can define America in one simple word <U+0097> possibilities.. If you<U+0092>re worried about whether you<U+0092>ll have a job, worried about the poisons in the air you breathe and water you drink, worried about your civil rights or even your basic dignity being under attack<U+0097>@KamalaHarris has had your back. Now, we have to have hers.. Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don<U+0092>t have anyone on their side with this president.
 
That<U+0092>s going to change in the Biden-Harris administration.. This morning, little girls woke up across this nation <U+0097> especially Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society <U+0097> potentially seeing themselves in a new way: As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents.. We<U+0092>ve all watched @KamalaHarris in the Senate go toe-to-toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that need to be asked <U+0097> and not stopping until she gets an answer. She<U+0092>s ready to do this job.. This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I will be speaking together for the first time since yesterday<U+0092>s big announcement. Tune in: https://t.co/xoRbSqGta8. Whether it's taking on the big banks or pushing for marriage equality<U+0097>Kamala never shies away from fighting tooth and nail for what's right. It's why I chose her to be my running mate.

She'll wake up every day thinking about how to make life better for the people of our country.. As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, @KamalaHarris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it firsthand.

Together, Kamala and I are going to fight every single day in the White House to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans.. If @KamalaHarris and I are elected, we<U+0092>re going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won<U+0092>t have a minute to waste.
 
That's exactly why I picked her: She's ready to lead on day one.. .@KamalaHarris is the daughter of proud immigrants<U+0097>a mother from India and a father from Jamaica<U+0097>who raised her to take action.
That<U+0092>s exactly what this moment calls for: action. And we hope you<U+0092>ll take action with us: https://t.co/K3mVwfTxXJ https://t.co/MZLAx9IN6C. Right now, America faces: 
 
- The worst pandemic in 100 years
- The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression
- The most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation
 
I need someone alongside me who's smart, tough, and ready to lead. @KamalaHarris is that person.. Thanks to supporters like you, we are on track to have our biggest fundraising day ever. Together, we can win this.

Join us. https://t.co/B7uyMcat6n. Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this<U+00A0>campaign.. I have the great honor to announce that I<U+0092>ve picked @KamalaHarris <U+0097> a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country<U+0092>s finest public servants <U+0097> as my running mate.. Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless.

I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need. https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h. I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control.

I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

We'll get it done, together.. This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong. Instead of standing for freedom and democracy, he consistently stands with Xi Jinping.

I'll put American values back at the center of our foreign policy. https://t.co/3RAZOeVtHr. Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement <U+0097> giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. I've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career <U+0097> and I'll continue that fight as president.. Folks, we need to listen to our frontline heroes. Wear a mask. It<U+0092>s not just about you. It<U+0092>s about keeping your family, neighbors, and fellow citizens safe. https://t.co/pbI6UVhqvh. Bristol Bay is no place for a mine <U+0097> our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO. https://t.co/RG38v0dRDk. President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable.

I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans. https://t.co/aXryhxVRtG. Donald Trump<U+0092>s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans. 

After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do: https://t.co/SOVOPL7uPy. To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now <U+0097> those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you <U+0097> and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you.. Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump <U+0097> then it's good enough for you and me.. It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson <U+0097> reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.. Our planet can<U+0092>t take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.. Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. His victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this November. https://t.co/iIFPTIB1Er. The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It<U+0092>s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn<U+0092>t have gotten this bad.. Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.

Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt. https://t.co/glUDQlcbEO. Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he<U+0092>s always wanted <U+0097> the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world. https://t.co/owvNL4ul74. It<U+0092>s an important choice, and I want you to be one of the first to know who I<U+0092>ve picked as my running mate <U+0096> text FIRST to 30330 to get notified when I<U+0092>ve made my decision.. Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before.. The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime <U+0097> and we're paying the price every single day. https://t.co/sZJCdivRo3. Our nation is desperate for leadership <U+0097> leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer.. No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.. Over the last century, America has defined itself by rising to meet existential challenges <U+0097> and we have that opportunity once again. But we can<U+0092>t just build back to the way things were before, we have to build back better.

Here<U+0092>s my plan for how we<U+0092>ll do it: https://t.co/nuBqg0TIfP. John Lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral America.

Donald Trump will not. https://t.co/vfZFeCUX3S. I can<U+0092>t believe I have to say this, but we can<U+0092>t let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining.. I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success <U+0097> not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That<U+0092>s why as president, I<U+0092>ll reverse Donald Trump<U+0092>s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.. Here<U+0092>s the truth<U+0097>Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans.

It's time we pick a different path. https://t.co/rt5RD9WOGA. Make no mistake: This economic crisis is due to President Trump<U+0092>s failure to get this virus under control. https://t.co/CBbk6SV39Q. While I am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million Americans still out of work. The truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but Donald Trump failed to act. He's the one person who should lose his job. https://t.co/eIHGRjwJd3. The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic<U+0097>it's obvious he still hasn<U+0092>t learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price. https://t.co/JOgA5Gpop4. Here<U+0092>s how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump<U+0097>Ducey model:

- An infection rate<U+0097>still<U+0097>of nearly 20%
- The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country
- More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19
- More than 183,000 cases
- Lengthy delays in test results. Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing.

He<U+0092>s withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it.

He<U+0092>s refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk.. President Trump called Arizona <U+0093>a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.<U+0094> He said Governor Ducey<U+0092>s approach should be used by other states<U+0097>but here<U+0092>s what<U+0092>s really happening in Arizona:. My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.. Throughout my career I've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place.. Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith<U+0097>not by identity, not on issues, not at all.. I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we<U+0092>ve got to:

- Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act
- Enact automatic and same-day voter registration
- Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts. John Lewis left us with marching orders. It<U+0092>s up to all of us to carry them out: https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M https://t.co/MTc6WHNnSR. Every moment with your loved ones is precious. I know that in my core because I<U+0092>ve learned it through loss. It's why as president, I'm going to do everything I can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can. https://t.co/qCsvryHMai. Let me be clear: Voting is a right <U+0097> not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can<U+0092>t be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.. The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. It's why I fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act. And it's why as president, I'll immediately sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act into law. https://t.co/fHqUvYahRR. 55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law <U+0097> bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we<U+0092>ve got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote.. The scenes of death and destruction from Hiroshima and Nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict<U+0097>and our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used. https://t.co/357jRzBPeL. If I'm elected president, our students and educators will have all the tools and resources they need to succeed and get through COVID-19. https://t.co/ul9vTTcT40. Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs, but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector<U+0097>and that was true even before COVID-19.

I<U+0092>ll revitalize American manufacturing and innovation and create millions of good-paying jobs so we can build back better. https://t.co/HrOOkWWQof. Growing up in Scranton, I learned the importance of hard work, treating others with dignity and respect, and leaving no one behind. Those values have guided my entire life <U+0097> and they're the values I'll bring back to the White House. https://t.co/aelfrxaISg. Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I<U+0092>m announcing my running mate, and I promise I<U+0092>ll let you know soon. But here<U+0092>s what I can tell you right now: I<U+0092>m going to tell my supporters first <U+0097> so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know.. I don<U+0092>t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. As president, I'll make bold investments in American manufacturing, industry, and innovation to make sure the future is made in America <U+0097> by all of America. https://t.co/LkIi8g6M5i. Weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the @NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons <U+0097> and as president, I<U+0092>ll ban these weapons again. https://t.co/ggqSaj40EJ. Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI <U+0097> ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence.. I truly believe that we can revitalize American manufacturing and create a better economy at the same time. I want to build an economy that brings everyone along <U+0097> one that works for the middle class, not just the wealthy and well-connected. https://t.co/3fYbFfsvDb. The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it. https://t.co/EPxDx4ecoU. From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action. 

Now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership.. On day one, I<U+0092>ll send a bill to Congress creating a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented people already strengthening our nation. It<U+0092>s long overdue. https://t.co/ajO7uUb9po. Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut. I urge both the Trump Administration and international community to immediately mobilize assistance to the thousands injured in the blast.. I<U+0092>ll get to work on day one enacting the changes needed to help the Latino community thrive.

Read my full plan here: https://t.co/SaL4WaFkEA https://t.co/vhwTRcwHlO. Happy birthday to my brother and friend, @BarackObama! Serving alongside you for eight years was the greatest honor of my life <U+0097> and I'm grateful to have you by my side for these next 91 days. https://t.co/qLl42Im40C. We can<U+0092>t just build back to the way things were before these crises. We have to build a more inclusive, equitable future for all.

Here<U+0092>s how we<U+0092>ll do it: https://t.co/SaL4WanJN2 https://t.co/IeMtNqBynx. The Latino community is bearing disproportionate harm from this pandemic. But even before, many Latino families were already struggling. We've got to do better. That's why today, I'm releasing my new agenda for the Latino community: https://t.co/xgGUoleGQO. As president, I<U+0092>ll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We can and will end our gun violence epidemic.. One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the @NRA and failed to deliver.. On July 1st, Donald Trump predicted the coronavirus was going to ""just disappear.""

He was wrong <U+0097> and more than 25,000 Americans died due to the virus last month.

Mr. President, step up and do your job before even more American families feel the pain of losing a loved one.. When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. Period.

We<U+0092>re going to make sure the future is made in America <U+0097> by all of America: https://t.co/uTI6GyuTpX. Every American should be able to safely make their voice heard this November. We need to:

- Expand vote-by-mail and early voting
- Implement online voter registration
- Make it safe and easy to vote in-person. Jill and I mourn the loss of the nine service members who perished in a training accident off the coast of California. These brave young men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their fellow Americans. Our deepest condolences go out to their families.. John Hume committed his life to the principles of nonviolence, and through his faith, statesmanship, and perseverance, he helped bring Northern Ireland through the Troubles to a better tomorrow. Jill and I send our condolences to the entire Hume family. https://t.co/5QmRsj2fSb. In the days that followed the El Paso shooting, I said Americans have to come together, stand against hate, and leave nobody behind.

That charge feels more important than ever. This is our fight <U+0097> and together, we will win. https://t.co/eX2xD0jhjX. It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I<U+0092>ll spend my Monday mornings working with our nation<U+0092>s top experts to control this virus <U+0097> not insulting them on Twitter. https://t.co/o7p3e0kgRJ. This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.

It won't be easy <U+0097> but it's a battle we must win.. One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso. He thought his hatred of Latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community.

He was wrong. https://t.co/d7ISze6dK7. Folks, there's simply too much at stake this November for anyone to sit on the sidelines. Register to vote today <U+0097> and then reach out to five friends and get them registered as well. https://t.co/8XWNjhwJzL. Welcome home, Bob and Doug! The first American splashdown in 45 years was executed with precision, and is truly a victory for American innovation and persistence. Congratulations to everyone involved on a successful conclusion to this historic mission. https://t.co/kYBNCHL75O. Join us as we host a roundtable with Congresswoman Veronica Escobar to commemorate the anniversary of the El Paso Massacre: https://t.co/LPA5wDYvNF. It<U+0092>s not enough to just go back to the way things were before these crises <U+0097> we need to build back better than ever. We have to create a new American economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.. This pandemic has put a bright light on the disparities that have plagued our nation for too long. We<U+0092>ve got to make sure these communities get the help they need now <U+0097> and root out the systemic racism that created these inequalities in the first place. https://t.co/KZZx2T9ojT. Enhanced unemployment benefits expired for millions overnight.

We don<U+0092>t have an effective nationwide testing program or a plan to control the virus.

Our health care workers still don<U+0092>t have enough PPE.

Enough with the weekend golf trips, Mr. President. Do your job.. Rent is due today.

Donald Trump abdicated his responsibility to lead us out of this COVID-19 crisis<U+0097>and we now face a potential housing crisis because of it.

Mr. President: Act now to make sure Americans don't have to choose between a roof over their heads or food on the table. https://t.co/b0Uoy5qoFr. You have enough on your plate <U+0097> you shouldn't also have to worry about the president making things even tougher for you. https://t.co/HjwhG8kQMT. If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of this nation.

We can<U+0092>t let that happen.. To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country run: I see you, and I promise I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America. https://t.co/009KRZx9Bq. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America <U+0097> and it's being written every day by folks like Dr. @Craig_A_Spencer, who fought the Ebola outbreak and now COVID-19. @BarackObama and I called to thank him for his service and discuss the moment we're in. https://t.co/wO14pwaaxa. Folks, we<U+0092>re just a few hours away from our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline. We need everyone to step up so we can hit our goal and make sure we can go toe-to-toe with President Trump.

If you're able, please chip in today: https://t.co/XAsy8zaW2v. Jill and I are keeping everyone in the path of Hurricane Isaias in our prayers. We must ensure that our fellow Americans, in Puerto Rico and across the East Coast, get the support they need. Please heed the warnings from authorities, take steps to prepare, and stay safe. https://t.co/Jb6AYJ4o0Q. Grassroots donations are the backbone of our campaign <U+0097> and we want to thank you for all your help. So tonight, Senator @ewarren and I are hosting an event that you won<U+0092>t want to miss.

Chip in to reserve your spot: https://t.co/KUyaCEAUi8 https://t.co/TiQzQ8tba7. We<U+0092>re facing some of the biggest challenges in our history <U+0097> and it<U+0092>s abundantly clear Donald Trump just isn<U+0092>t up for the job.

We need real leadership <U+0097> and we need it now.. It<U+0092>s been over six months since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, and President Trump still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. It's an unjustifiable failure of leadership that costs lives every day.. .@DrBiden and I wish all our Muslim friends and neighbors a blessed #EidAlAdha. May your sacrifices on this day be accepted and strengthen you during these challenging times. Eid Mubarak!. Human trafficking is an unconscionable attack on the dignity of the most vulnerable among us. Action can<U+0092>t wait <U+0097> on this World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, we<U+0092>ve got to join together and commit to ending trafficking. #EndHumanTrafficking https://t.co/5UJHwaMRQI. 55 years ago today, Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law. And ever since, they've extended lives, enhanced liberty, and put the pursuit of happiness within reach for millions.

I'll protect and expand these programs for generations to come. https://t.co/haLz46TAOD. Throughout his life, John Lewis taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.

It's up to all of us to carry on his mission. https://t.co/VUJdegsBuw. It<U+0092>s time Senate Republicans back their effusive praise of John Lewis with action. Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.. Even after his passing, John Lewis reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation.

May his words guide us as we march on toward November. https://t.co/wmxgIqDDAi. The last three months were the worst period for economic growth our nation has experienced in the 70 years since we started measuring it <U+0097> a drop of nearly 33 percent.

Let's be clear: This is no act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership. https://t.co/pPZXkHtJcR. I'm the proud husband of a teacher. I've seen firsthand how difficult the job can be in normal times <U+0097> let alone in the middle of a pandemic. So when I heard Beth's story, I knew @BarackObama and I had to give her a call. https://t.co/xBdeItoMW6. Donald Trump's instinct to constantly add fuel to the fire is the last thing our country needs right now.

We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. https://t.co/tNUQUYDO8P. We need a president who will bring us together instead of tearing us apart and who will enforce the law faithfully rather than put his own political interests first. https://t.co/SL7dojwyDi. Folks, I'm excited to share that Senator @ewarren and I are hosting a grassroots fundraiser this Friday <U+0097> and you're invited. We're going to chat about what's at stake this November and even answer a few of your questions.

Chip in any amount to join us: https://t.co/Ak0FXcwfoV https://t.co/j6OGUieI46. Donald Trump has shown that he can<U+0092>t beat the pandemic or turn the economy around. And he is unsurprisingly stoking the flames of division for political gain.

He is the worst possible person to lead our nation through this moment. https://t.co/CfJzEwU6Cm. My heart goes out to Jessica and the countless others across the nation who have lost a loved one due to COVID-19. Behind every number we see in the news is a family and community that will never again be whole <U+0097> and we can't forget that. https://t.co/S2NrhkXrHI. Congratulations to California Child Care Providers United on a successful election. As president, I'll make it easier for child care workers to unionize <U+0097> and I<U+0092>ll provide resources so they earn higher wages while also making care more affordable. #ChildCareIsEssential https://t.co/49zAdq9Mte. We need an effective, coordinated nationwide testing and tracing program. We need more PPE for health care workers. We need a comprehensive plan to get this virus under control.

We need this president to do his job.. I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is. But I<U+0092>m optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.

There is nothing we're unable to achieve when we do it together.. Small business ownership is one of our country's cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. But Black and Brown entrepreneurs face far too many barriers to ownership, growth, and success.

I've got a plan to change that: https://t.co/27Y38un2tM https://t.co/MF7OpMS7bA. America has never lived up to our founding promise <U+0097> and we can<U+0092>t rest until we finally do. My new plan will advance racial equity across the American economy and bring us closer to reaching our highest ideals: https://t.co/27Y38u5rCe https://t.co/pQGZ78PXwC. My housing plan will give a $15,000 tax credit to first-time home-buyers, expand affordable housing, and reverse President Trump<U+0092>s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement.

We're going to remove the barriers to homeownership that hold back too many Americans of color.. To support more Black and Brown small businesses, my administration will launch a new Small Business Opportunity Initiative. We're going to make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.. In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back.

We have to break the cycle, and I<U+0092>ve got a plan to do it: https://t.co/27Y38un2tM. This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It<U+0092>s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people<U+0092>s struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.. A change of <U+0093>tone<U+0094> over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.

Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects.. The Senate and this President should pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act <U+0097> renamed yesterday in memory of John Lewis.

If they don<U+0092>t, it will be one of the first things I do as president.. I'm in Wilmington, Delaware, to unveil the fourth plank of my Build Back Better plan. Tune in as I discuss what my administration will do to advance racial equity in our economy: https://t.co/NTZviQqUX5. In this moment, we have the chance to build an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. One more vibrant and more powerful because everyone is in on the deal.

Here's how we'll do it: https://t.co/27Y38un2tM https://t.co/d0kM3yyglS. We can't build this nation back better without tackling the systemic racism and disparities that have plagued our country for far too long. That's why today, I'm releasing my new plan to advance racial economic equity across the American economy. https://t.co/MQW8ItM0J8. Our students and educators deserve better than four more years of Betsy DeVos. It<U+0092>s time for a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator. https://t.co/rUVThAQ24K.

It's why as president, I'll ease the financial burden on families and expand access to dignified care for older Americans. https://t.co/Z8FOorRgLe.

As president, I'll give every 3- and 4-year-old access to free, high-quality preschool. And low- to middle-income families won<U+0092>t spend more than 7% of their income on quality care for children under age 5.. We are trapped in a caregiving crisis, within an economic crisis, within a public health crisis. You<U+0092>re doing everything you can, but this president is not.

If I<U+0092>m your president, here<U+0092>s what I would do: https://t.co/RbUFxJldQq. Donald Trump simply doesn<U+0092>t understand: We can<U+0092>t deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.

Together, we'll get it done.. Mr. President, your ignorance isn<U+0092>t a virtue or a sign of your strength <U+0097> it<U+0092>s undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it<U+0092>s costing Americans their jobs and their lives. https://t.co/PXSNiGNa6w.

We deserve to know what this president is hiding.. Everyone wants our schools to reopen. The question is how to make it safe and how to make it stick.

It<U+0092>s long past time for you to step up and do your job.. This pandemic has gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public.

I<U+0092>m glad he made that shift <U+0097> but it<U+0092>s not enough.

To beat COVID-19, we need a coordinated national response from the federal government <U+0097> but Donald Trump refuses to do his job.

On this Venezuelan Independence Day, my thoughts are with Venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy. It<U+0092>s time for free and fair elections so that the Venezuelan people can turn the page on the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime.. COVID-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. It's heartless and cruel and must be stopped.. Donald Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. But he<U+0092>s wrong <U+0097> on both fronts.

We need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises..

It<U+0092>s time for you to step up, take action, and lead. https://t.co/8UlIAKzv1q. Donald Trump styled himself as a wartime president. But now it seems this president has surrendered. He has waved the white flag and left the field of battle when we need him most. It's unacceptable.

We need real leadership. Right now. https://t.co/2T3WbFLYV3. We are five months into this crisis, and our health care workers still don't have the masks and protective equipment they need. It's a national disgrace.

Mr. President, use your authority and fix the shortage of PPE before you tee off for yet another round of golf.. Donald Trump has called himself a ""cheerleader"" for the nation. But we don't need a cheerleader <U+0097> we need a President. One who will:

- Lead by example
- Take responsibility
- Tell the unvarnished truth
- Listen to the experts and follow the science. Let me be clear: There<U+0092>s no victory to be celebrated when we<U+0092>re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better. https://t.co/60inyb1vT9. This is a shameful move. Now is the time for employers to have empathy for families juggling work and caregiving.

It's long past time for President Trump to show some leadership so we can get this virus under control. https://t.co/Z2DsWMCcLf. Tune in as I address the nation on the economic crisis and the latest jobs report: https://t.co/SKrDmWptL4. Mr. President, this pandemic isn't about you. It's about the health and well-being of the American people. https://t.co/uxRijdtTmj. Small businesses are the backbone of communities across our nation, and we need to do so much more to help them. Donald Trump may have forgotten about them <U+0097> but I never will. https://t.co/RDYKzt1Qc1. If the reports are true, Donald Trump either read his briefings about the Russian bounties and did nothing <U+0097> or he didn't read them at all. Either way, it's an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.

The American people deserve answers. https://t.co/LuDqIUrjhP. On day one, I<U+0092>ll get right to work tackling COVID-19. I'll bring together our nation's top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

We are all in this together <U+0097> and we've got to fight this together. https://t.co/7An2MOGiiF. We need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period.

We<U+0092>re facing a serious threat <U+0097> and we need to meet it together as one country. But this President gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another.

We can't continue on like this. https://t.co/LA8OJ86Nnk. If I<U+0092>m elected, I<U+0092>ll immediately reach out to Dr. Fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. 

I<U+0092>ll have the nation<U+0092>s top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day one <U+0097> and I'll actually listen to them.. Mr. President, the American people didn<U+0092>t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.

Step up. Take responsibility. Do your job.. Tune in as I deliver remarks on how President Trump failed to protect the American people, save our economy, and control the virus: https://t.co/pqbJECpUHQ. I want every single American to know: if you<U+0092>re sick, if you<U+0092>re struggling, if you<U+0092>re worried about how you<U+0092>re going to get through the day <U+0097> I will not abandon you. I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.

We are going to get through this <U+0097> together.. As simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. So much of this could have been prevented if Donald Trump listened to someone other than himself.. Folks, tomorrow night marks our first end-of-quarter deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal so we can catch up to Donald Trump's hefty cash-on-hand advantage.
 
I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today: https://t.co/mv8ZZdhwAI. Here<U+0092>s my promise to you: I<U+0092>ll appoint a director who will actually go after financial predators and protect consumers. https://t.co/LYY54KXbUk. Today's decision reaffirmed that states can't put in place laws that unduly burden a woman's right to make her own health care decisions<U+0097>but the fight isn't over. As President, I'll codify Roe v. Wade and protect a woman<U+0092>s constitutional right to choose. 
https://t.co/qFrH8hFst8. It's time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity and respect, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.

We are everything that Donald Trump is not.. William Perry Pendley spent his career fighting to sell off public lands <U+0097> and to allow drilling, mining, and logging on them with hardly any oversight. 

Now the President has nominated him to oversee them at @BLMNational. Consider me opposed. https://t.co/jwlQGs68kO. White supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history <U+0097> not promoted by the President of the United States.. Obamacare was and is a big deal. We can't let Donald Trump tear it down <U+0097> we have to protect and build on it. https://t.co/P9QZvidZmD. 51 years ago today, a movement was born on Christopher Street. As we remember the anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising and the brave individuals who changed our world forever, let's recommit to finishing the job and finally achieving full LGBTQ+ equality. #Pride https://t.co/PzbGOMy0zx. Donald Trump's entire presidency has been a gift to Putin, but this is beyond the pale. It<U+0092>s a betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation, to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm<U+0092>s way. https://t.co/r6DCWowxc4. Today the President shared a video of people shouting <U+0093>white power<U+0094> and said they were <U+0093>great.<U+0094> Just like he did after Charlottesville. 

We<U+0092>re in a battle for the soul of the nation <U+0097> and the President has picked a side. But make no mistake: it<U+0092>s a battle we will win.. Children should be released from ICE detention with their parents immediately. This is pretty simple, and I can't believe I have to say it: Families belong together. https://t.co/11F5X71AO1. Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves just how unfit he is to lead our nation.. If Donald Trump prevails in the U.S. Supreme Court, insurers could strip away your health insurance coverage or jack up premiums <U+0097> simply because you experience long-term effects after battling the coronavirus.

We can't let that happen. https://t.co/cpgHP1FQuS. I know these times are dark, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish.. Health care is a right for all <U+0097> not a privilege for the few. We have to ensure every single American has access to the care they need and deserve.

Here<U+0092>s what I would do as president: https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT https://t.co/4zuTzH6zt9. Congratulations, Alexis. We need you in this fight. Proud to stand with you and Planned Parenthood Action Fund. https://t.co/7x7UP9KutR. Last week, President Trump claimed the virus would ""fade away.""

Now, we're facing a record-high number of new cases, and it's surging across the country.

Trump refuses to listen to the experts and take action <U+0097> and we're all paying the price.. In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to root out systemic racism and close the racial wealth and income gaps. We can do it, together. https://t.co/l6AmXzfDDB. The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus <U+0097> we've lost lives, businesses, paychecks. And now, we're losing the progress we've made because this president refuses to do his job.

Donald Trump has failed our nation every step of the way. https://t.co/k5CCKcJzjZ. While President Trump continues his victory lap, over 20 million Americans remain out of work. He may have forgotten about you, but I never will <U+0097> and I'll fight for you every single day in the White House. https://t.co/cuBH5ufI2f. While the Trump Administration continues their efforts to rip health care away from millions, I'm speaking about how we can make quality, affordable health care available to every American.  Tune in: https://t.co/CJ8KWt4Z2M.

Restoring the soul of America means fixing democracy at home, and confronting <U+0097> not cozying up to <U+0097> dictators around the world. When I'm president, America will defend democracy at home and abroad. https://t.co/3L6gqvXgI7. This virus is not just going to disappear because you want it to, Mr. President.

Listen to the experts. Take clear, concrete action. Do your job. https://t.co/kXUiBzMYWS.

Brian <U+0097> the courage and strength you've shown in the face of daunting odds is an inspiration to us all. I'm confident that with folks like you leading the way and with the power of our best minds, we'll find treatments and cures and beat this thing once and for all. https://t.co/QbwQoEaAp7. Instead of passing police reform or helping hardworking Americans get through this crisis, Republicans are jamming through another one of Trump<U+0092>s unqualified nominees. It's wrong.

To everyone who is scared, hurting, and wondering what's going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I hear you. And I'll fight for you every single day in the White House. https://t.co/UDQiuTX69L. The American people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. There<U+0092>s not a single thing we can't do if we do it together.. It's clear Donald Trump will stop at nothing to tear down Obamacare and rip health care away from millions. We cannot let him get away with it. We have to build on the ACA with a new public option to ensure everyone receives the care they deserve. https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C. It's pretty simple: If we want to save people's jobs and save people's lives, we need more testing <U+0097> and we need it faster. The President is intentionally slowing it down. https://t.co/bu1oq1TwzL. This is yet another attempt to distract from this Administration's failure to lead an effective response to COVID-19. Immigrants help grow our economy and create jobs. The President can't scapegoat his way out of this crisis. https://t.co/FEqWNJG6TK. It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.

He continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation.. To Ashley, and all the health care workers on the front lines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes. https://t.co/B6UCR5xmhc. Tomorrow, President @BarackObama and I are hosting a virtual grassroots fundraiser.

Read more here: https://t.co/v6hImc0J3q. We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can't stand by and let that happen.. From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President <U+0097> I've spent my career fighting against injustice. And I'm not finished yet. https://t.co/vJ7jDk9OCH. Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolas Maduro. 

As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy. https://t.co/eUt28UxyXS. Trump opposed sanctioning China<U+0092>s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.

Where Trump has been weak, I will be strong, clear, and consistent in standing up for America's values and its people. https://t.co/AgGPD46JJN. My dad instilled a lot in me, but perhaps most important is the belief that there<U+0092>s no higher calling than to be a good parent.

It<U+0092>s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we<U+0092>ve made some of our greatest progress. If we stand together, as one America, we'll rise stronger than before. https://t.co/buzkmkM1Gf.

This nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope, but Trump has made it clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge. 

As president, I'll recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America. #WorldRefugeeDay 

https://t.co/akD4aANCia. Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 <U+0097> but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains: https://t.co/bEPmsRgZDo. Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he<U+0092>s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines <U+0097> as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.

Unbelievable.. The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history <U+0097> and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.

It<U+0092>s time we reckon with what happened in 1921. https://t.co/wYX3Adq3vN. Christian Cooper<U+0092>s encounter in Central Park was another wake-up call for our nation and a reminder of the work that remains to root out hate and intolerance. I'm grateful for Christian's support and know with folks like him leading the way, we'll get the job done. https://t.co/XWhcTjbo0t. We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:

- Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs
- Stands in the way of the CDC
- Refuses to wear a mask

He is failing even the most basic test of leadership.. I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for <U+0097> and we are all called to the cause.

None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent.. Donald Trump<U+0092>s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives <U+0097> and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.. I<U+0092>ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important <U+0097> who we want to be. It<U+0092>s all at stake.

That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election: https://t.co/gGeSmBIIxA. On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, TX, the last enslaved African Americans were finally given notice of their freedom. 155 years later, we're still on the long road to equality, equity, and fairness for all.

We can't rest until the promise of this nation is fulfilled. #Juneteenth https://t.co/ZHOH8Hz57H. #Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity<U+0097>but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all.. Amy <U+0097> from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we<U+0092>re going to beat Donald Trump. https://t.co/4kquPZtSV9. Climate change is linked to increased pregnancy risks <U+0097> and heartbreakingly, Black mothers are being hit the hardest. As President, I'll work every day to tackle the climate crisis head-on and root out injustice. Because they are intertwined. https://t.co/egmxpkXoLc. To all the Dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: Thank you. This country needs you. #HomeIsHere https://t.co/VZPVqY1cgq. The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court <U+0097> and the generational impact its justices can have.

We have the power to shape the Court's future this November <U+0097> and we can<U+0092>t forget that.. Just like Donald Trump couldn<U+0092>t wish COVID-19 away in March, and just like he couldn<U+0092>t tweet it away in April <U+0097> he can<U+0092>t ignore it away in June. https://t.co/nOBnrL4rWi. Here<U+0092>s my promise to you: On day one, I<U+0092>ll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It<U+0092>s long overdue.. It didn<U+0092>t have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.

We need a president who will put the American people first <U+0097> and actually do the work. https://t.co/Lk1GDmSmAM. Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it. https://t.co/kxBBzhxvxc. The Supreme Court<U+0092>s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. And as President, I will get to work immediately to make it permanent. https://t.co/xKkCp4P9Ff. Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy <U+0097> but he has surrendered the fight.

Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.. Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are <U+0093>down to<U+0094> fewer than 750 a day.

That's more than 20,000 a month <U+0097> and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.

It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President. https://t.co/9h08nxjC6k. I<U+0092>m proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today<U+0092>s #WorkersFirst Caravan. Senate Republicans need to pass the #HeroesAct now and take action to root out systemic racism. https://t.co/s5zCJBXYIp. If John Bolton's accounts are true, it<U+0092>s not only morally repugnant, it<U+0092>s a violation of Donald Trump<U+0092>s sacred duty to the American people to protect America<U+0092>s interests and defend our values.. Donald Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it <U+0097> and now in many states, COVID cases are on the rise again.

This president has failed to lead our nation. https://t.co/1fdu8WMeN5. Five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world <U+0097> killed by hate and white supremacy. Today, we honor the memory of the Emanuel Nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind. https://t.co/zpVG2ak8aK. I'm in Darby, Pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in: https://t.co/VaCPc32w9A. The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.

It has to change.. I<U+0092>ve said it before, and I<U+0092>ll say it again: Donald Trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern American history. https://t.co/6Uxn50HzH9. We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all <U+0097> not just the powerful.

Let<U+0092>s do it together.. We can<U+0092>t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.. Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement <U+0097> and we have to do the hard work to root it out. In January, I sat down with Jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward: https://t.co/mVkxpWxbod. This virus won<U+0092>t just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It<U+0092>s time for you to step up and do your job.. Los Dreamers son estadounidenses. Trump les quit<f3> la protecci<f3>n que lograron con tanto esfuerzo. Esto es inaceptable. El primer d<ed>a de mi presidencia enviar<e9> un proyecto de ley al Congreso que proteger<e1> a los beneficiarios de DACA de la deportaci<f3>n. https://t.co/mGmTA03HEq. Folks, I<U+0092>ve got some big news: Next week, I<U+0092>m getting together with my friend and former boss, President @BarackObama, for a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We would love to see you there.
 
Chip in now to get your ticket: https://t.co/UD3RHHKIw1. Dreamers are Americans. But Trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It<U+0092>s unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress. https://t.co/YlvFuCaTrZ. I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn<U+0092>t, and it won<U+0092>t. American history isn<U+0092>t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.
 
It's up to all of us to do the hard work to ensure the American ideal finally wins out. https://t.co/iUyi82zXN7. I'm grateful for @PPact's support and proud to stand with them in this fight. As president, I<U+0092>m going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care <U+0097> including reproductive health care. https://t.co/dYHAOGlfSQ. Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he does bear full responsibility for his slow, uncoordinated, bungled response. https://t.co/IUdWpqZncn. Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.

Here<U+0092>s what I would do as president: https://t.co/Ni1rAm8DNZ. Today's decision is another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect. But we're not done. https://t.co/Bz4SMA9tgb. After reports of wealthy Trump donors getting millions in relief meant for small businesses, the administration is now refusing to disclose where the PPP money went. It's unacceptable.

The American people deserve answers. https://t.co/F2n3PA7RZU. In every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. It gives me so much hope.

Together, we<U+0092>re going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all.. We need a president who heals <U+0097> not one who fans the flames of hate.
 
We need a president who unites <U+0097> not one who sows further discord for political gain.
 
We need a president who leads the way with a steady hand <U+0097> not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets.. We<U+0092>re facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation<U+0092>s history <U+0097> and it<U+0092>s clear Donald Trump isn<U+0092>t up for the job.

We need real leadership, right now.. We have to ensure every worker called back on the job has access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing and effective personal protective equipment. https://t.co/lDPQP3jZkw. We need a president who will fight to further LGBTQ+ equality <U+0097> not roll back the hard-won progress we've already made.. Our nation is at an inflection point. We can't go back to the way things were before <U+0097> we have to take a bold step forward and usher in a new era of equality and opportunity.

We can do it, together.. Here's my promise to you: I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation <U+0097> not use them for political gain.

We shouldn<U+0092>t accept anything less from an American president. https://t.co/I0r60NW4SU. I<U+0092>ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.
 
We can<U+0092>t let that happen.. In light of Donald Trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, I want to share a conversation I had a few weeks ago. Adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. Period. https://t.co/nr1u0vOvog. On the fourth anniversary of Pulse.
In the middle of Pride month.
During a global pandemic.

Donald Trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. We have to defeat him this November. https://t.co/YAy4ZGxxyD. Two years after Trump's Singapore meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the U.S. and our allies are less safe and Kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing. Photo-ops and love letters are no substitute for deterrence and principled diplomacy. https://t.co/YfaCdlwJ8S. Medgar Evers once said, ""freedom has never been free."" On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today.. Four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at Pulse nightclub. As we remember those we lost <U+0097> including so many in the LGBTQ+ and Hispanic communities <U+0097> we have to double down on our efforts to #HonorThemWithAction. https://t.co/TKaZ4M7IFF. We need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:

- Outlaw chokeholds
- Improve oversight and accountability
- Create a model use of force standard
- Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces. Donald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn<U+0092>t forget about us. 

The President couldn<U+0092>t wish away the virus in April, he couldn<U+0092>t tweet it away in May, and he can<U+0092>t ignore it away in June.. We can't let history repeat itself <U+0097> Facebook needs to act now to stop the spread of disinformation and protect our elections. Watch my deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield break down what's happening and how you can help us fix it: https://t.co/WYMMAWkuLZ https://t.co/OGG2wwtW2P. COVID-19 can affect anyone, anywhere <U+0097> but it doesn't impact every community equally. Watch as Dr. Ebony Jade Hilton explains how it<U+0092>s impacting communities of color: https://t.co/3uuXEsfyv4. While the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week.
 
He is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country <U+0097> and hardworking Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/AglBowCtKc. We have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong <U+0097> and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. Today, I'm releasing my plan to make that happen: https://t.co/v6hImc0J3q. We have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen: https://t.co/7WIbtob6WE. We have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen: https://t.co/lWNMjkTf06. With less than 150 days until Election Day, the stakes couldn't be higher. We've got to fix Facebook to protect our democracy and ensure fair elections.
 
If you agree, sign the open letter today to demand Facebook take action. #MoveFastFixIt https://t.co/6Hmta4UxS9. So far, Facebook has failed to enact any real reforms to stop the spread of disinformation on its platform. Time is running out.
 
Today, we're releasing an open letter demanding the company change its policies: https://t.co/S1WIQTsfEL. Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.
 
We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020.. It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress <U+0097> and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.. There is systemic racism not just in our law enforcement but also in housing, education, and everything we do <U+0097> and we have to do the hard work to end it. https://t.co/w9H77Jbuqa. We have to make this an era of action <U+0097> starting with real police reform. No more excuses. No more delays.
 
Add your name to demand Congress ban chokeholds <U+0097> and pass real police reform <U+0097> right now: https://t.co/Sa6sPy2BtS. This pandemic isn't just going to go away because you want it to, Mr. President. Step up and do your job before your negligence costs even more lives than it already has. https://t.co/L6QfV31eFQ. Ignore the polls. We can't take anything for granted this November <U+0097> the stakes are simply too high.

Let's get to work. https://t.co/gI5KfaGsYI. Nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years. 
 
But I<U+0092>m ready to get to work on day one. We can<U+0092>t accept anything less from an American president.. Donald Trump<U+0092>s hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country<U+0097>but just fixing the way the president talks won<U+0092>t cut it. We need to root out systemic racism and ensure Black Americans have a real shot to get ahead. https://t.co/FhgRNPjKR8. America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We<U+0092>ve never fully lived up to that promise <U+0097> and we can<U+0092>t rest until we finally do.. From ballot shortages and issues with machines to hours-long lines <U+0097> what happened today in Georgia should enrage us all. We need to act now to prevent it from happening again in November. Our democracy depends on it. https://t.co/LLhBr8qVQw. Because of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence:
 
- More than 110,000 people have died
- We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19
- Over 20 million Americans are out of work
 
And yet he<U+0092>s patting himself on the back. Unbelievable.. Small businesses like Rafael's are the backbone of communities all across this nation. We have to do so much more to help them through this crisis. https://t.co/msi1oZ6P24. Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.
 
We need justice. We need action. We need reform.. Grief is a heavy burden to bear <U+0097> and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. I know. But that burden is now a purpose <U+0097> to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.

That's the message I shared with his loved ones during today's service: https://t.co/2LKJzwBUSO. My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.

Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.

I'm a Catholic <U+0096> just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either.. This moment is a wake-up call for all of us. It's long past time we deal with systemic racism, growing economic inequality, and the denial of the promise of this nation to so many. https://t.co/IV4EVWAfRO. Donald Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from the Obama-Biden Administration, but like everything else he<U+0092>s inherited, he has squandered it. https://t.co/395A6eJAzm. To everyone speaking out and peacefully demanding justice across the nation: I see you, I hear you, and I stand with you. https://t.co/gsqiDcEZUo. At every turn, President Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people <U+0097> and we<U+0092>re all paying the price every single day. https://t.co/klaYVm3gpY. We've made incredible progress on LGBTQ+ equality, but we still have further to go. We can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law<U+0097>regardless of who they are or whom they love.

Join #OutForBiden and let's get to work: https://t.co/UMiuglr9XX https://t.co/hHNVoCU2q5. We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what<U+0092>s really going on in this country.
 
It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions.. American history isn<U+0092>t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.

Don't let anyone tell you differently.. Our nation is at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics <U+0097> or we can take the next great step forward. https://t.co/AbLAYAUsZx. These disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It<U+0092>s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations <U+0097> and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps. https://t.co/KforFaypAP. This isn<U+0092>t about politics. This is about the future of our country. Grateful for your support, Secretary Powell. https://t.co/0xLPyXiIPb. The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.
 
We cannot give him another four years in the White House.. We need to stand up as a nation <U+0097> with the Black community and with all minority communities <U+0097> and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.
 
It is the duty of every American to grapple with it <U+0097> and grapple with it now.. I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn<U+0092>t just become another hashtag <U+0097> and I intend to keep that promise.
 
We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.. To all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what<U+0092>s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won<U+0092>t ever forget you. And I won<U+0092>t be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you. https://t.co/YxQ2OaeSyQ. Today, we honor those who answered duty<U+0092>s call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice<U+0097>and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDay. Today, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. But ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause. 

No one can stay silent. https://t.co/nZjQdJGKbD. We're just 150 days out from Election Day, and the stakes have never been higher. We have to defeat Donald Trump, and once we do, we won<U+0092>t just rebuild this country <U+0097> we'll transform it. Together.
 
Help us make it happen: https://t.co/AflPBScS1L. Donald Trump was warned, but he failed to act. Now more than 20 million Americans are out of a job and paying the price. It didn<U+0092>t have to be this bad. https://t.co/Hut7pquZUU. Folks, tonight we secured the 1,991 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. I'm going to spend every day fighting to earn your vote so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation. https://t.co/sl3wFGabpg. Tonight, I<U+0092>m thinking of Breonna Taylor<U+0092>s mother, Tamika Palmer. Today should have been her daughter's birthday. I've talked a lot about turning pain into purpose. But for Breonna and Tamika, it<U+0092>s on us to find purpose. Our country needs to act <U+0097> now. https://t.co/Ql2SyMew76. Donald Trump still doesn<U+0092>t get it. He<U+0092>s out there spiking the football <U+0097> completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives. https://t.co/ZNbTRsdVdS. This #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.

The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop.. When it comes to this economic crisis, Donald Trump either doesn<U+0092>t know what<U+0092>s going on, or he just doesn<U+0092>t care. https://t.co/db8axnf704. Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. But don't just take my word for it: https://t.co/eD9z51pXDQ. Let<U+0092>s be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God <U+0097> but to the failure of a President.. George Floyd<U+0092>s last words, <U+0093>I can<U+0092>t breathe,<U+0094> have echoed across our nation and around the world.

For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable. https://t.co/8dWu78dtGP. Tune in as I speak about the latest jobs report and the state of the economy: https://t.co/pfELb1jmqa. We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.
 
We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.
 
We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.. To everyone struggling with mental health<U+0097>you're not alone. There is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help.
 
Together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. https://t.co/QXplsIwYTL. It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I<U+0092>ll do my job and take responsibility. I won<U+0092>t blame others. And I<U+0092>ll never forget that the job isn<U+0092>t about me <U+0097> it<U+0092>s about you.. Jim Mattis and I haven<U+0092>t always agreed on everything, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more powerful indictment of Trump's actions and character than the one he's written. 
""We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose."" https://t.co/T0F5TEjwqe. I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn<U+0092>t, and it won<U+0092>t. American history isn<U+0092>t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.

It's up to all of us to create the America we know we can be. https://t.co/LNI2e3d3lz. More than 42 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and Black and Latino communities are being hit hardest. https://t.co/qXnKEf1JMF. There<U+0092>s no time to waste <U+0097> we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. Congressman @Hakeem_Jeffries has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. Congress should put it on President Trump<U+0092>s desk in the next few days. Period. https://t.co/w8XkHwFcBt. Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.

I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? https://t.co/taSpWIFT1b. It<U+0092>s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we<U+0092>ve made some of our greatest progress <U+0097> and we have that chance once again. We<U+0092>re not just going to rebuild this nation <U+0097> we<U+0092>re going to transform it. 

There is nothing we can<U+0092>t do if we do it together. https://t.co/iozMdaLtAw. If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation <U+0097> closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be.. I ask all of America <U+0097> not to deny our pain or cover it over <U+0097> but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.. If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump<U+0092>s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution<U+0092>s promise of equal protection under the law.

No more excuses. No more delays.. When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.

When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.

Donald Trump was elected to serve us all <U+0097> but he only looks out for himself.. The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. I won<U+0092>t either.

But I promise you this: I won<U+0092>t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country <U+0097> not use them for political gain. https://t.co/TfNaoMRZQp. That<U+0092>s what the presidency is: a duty of care <U+0097> to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us. https://t.co/rWHywb5cHV. <U+0093>I can<U+0092>t breathe.<U+0094>
 
George Floyd<U+0092>s last words. But they didn<U+0092>t die with him. They<U+0092>re still being heard. They<U+0092>re echoing across this nation.
 
It<U+0092>s a wake-up call for all of us. https://t.co/q6kARnpJqU. Juli<e1>n <U+0097> I made a promise to George's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. We're going to tackle this head on <U+0097> and we're going to need your help to do it. Grateful for your support. https://t.co/D0Ssv4hU2S. I<U+0092>ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.

Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important<U+0097>who we want to be. It<U+0092>s all at stake.
 
That is truer today than ever. And it<U+0092>s in this urgency we can find the path forward.. The President held up a bible at St. John<U+0092>s church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something: 

That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. 

That<U+0092>s hard work. But it<U+0092>s the work of America.. A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time.. Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  This morning I'm speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. Tune in: https://t.co/1bSdeXp8Rc. Pride is a global movement of love, self-expression, and community <U+0097> resilient in the face of oppression and fear and hopeful for a better future. This month, let us recommit to those principles and remain steadfast in the fight for justice and equality. https://t.co/cNxsmEFW6R. He's using the American military against the American people.

He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.

For a photo.

For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together. https://t.co/G1yE67q9Nz. In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.
 
We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.
 
We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.. After another night of unrest in America, I<U+0092>m hosting a virtual roundtable with mayors from across the country to discuss where we go from here. Tune in: https://t.co/qyXzbDdSBq. We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. 

As President, I will help lead this conversation <U+0097> and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington. https://t.co/0h2ApbKT0C. We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF. Trump<U+0092>s Tantrum Diplomacy is eroding U.S. credibility on the international stage. Withdrawing from @WHO during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the American response. We must instead rally the world to confront COVID-19. https://t.co/rIlUewZNyI. If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.

None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out.. You can't defeat bigotry; it only hides. And when leaders give it oxygen <U+0097> as Donald Trump has done <U+0097> it comes roaring back.

We all have a moral obligation to stand up, speak out, and hold people accountable. https://t.co/vES2aIXVGl. Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel. https://t.co/AskxceOJJU. Every day that Donald Trump spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. He is wholly unfit to be president. https://t.co/Fq90hSLuLz. This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.

This is a national crisis <U+0097> and we need real leadership right now.. We are a country with an open wound.

None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words <U+0097> <U+0093>I can<U+0092>t breathe<U+0094> <U+0097> and do nothing.

We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. https://t.co/veodlR1UYU. It<U+0092>s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.

It<U+0092>s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.

We need justice for George Floyd.. Tune in as I address the unfolding situation in Minnesota and the killing of George Floyd: https://t.co/AKk14gGif5. I will not lift the President<U+0092>s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I<U+0092>m furious, and you should be too.. This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.. We<U+0092>re months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy.
 
I do: https://t.co/MTnecpzZgv. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America <U+0097> and we<U+0092>re seeing it written every single day. It gives me hope. https://t.co/hK8AbPKZue. 100,000+ lives lost across the country.
1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases.
40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.

Donald Trump has failed our nation.. Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump<U+0092>s utter failure of leadership. https://t.co/YSHGLBdMLG. Thirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I<U+0092>m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities: https://t.co/psuNvKzYej. Presidents are supposed to lead by example <U+0097> and every day Donald Trump proves how incapable he is of doing that. https://t.co/B0t497xxHc. .@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero. Through his activism, Larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job. His outspokenness raised our consciousness on HIV/AIDS and saved countless lives. https://t.co/ZdFE2Pq32w. There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.

To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you. https://t.co/SBBRKV4mPZ. Over the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.

Read more from @TammyforIL and me: https://t.co/W7h54A91U9. We<U+0092>re in the middle of a global pandemic <U+0097> and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he<U+0092>s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.

It<U+0092>s morally reprehensible.. Tune in now as @TomWolfPA joins me for a conversation on how COVID-19 is impacting states: https://t.co/3gMLagg78X. This morning, I<U+0092>ll be joined by @TomWolfPA for a conversation on how COVID-19 is making an impact on states. 

Tune in live at 10:30AM EDT: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/D6Ewy1xm78. Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.

Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.

I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November.. George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.

I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved <U+0097> they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation. https://t.co/n1tdiUba0x. Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.

We need a government that works for all <U+0097> not just the super-wealthy.. The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president<U+0097>especially in times as tough as these. But we<U+0092>re coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and I need your help to ensure we hit our goal.

If you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/af28OgWn2G. 1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It<U+0092>s a crisis unlike anything we<U+0092>ve seen in our lifetime <U+0097> and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.. Folks, today we<U+0092>re launching #League46<U+26BE><U+FE0F> <U+0097> a next generation coalition ready to make Donald Trump a one-term president. We've got unlimited capacity to create change <U+0097> and together, we<U+0092>re going to transform this country.

Join today: https://t.co/Rnwttcaugo https://t.co/Dbez4mtrwx. So much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.. We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable. I released a detailed plan laying out what I would do months ago, and have built on it since. Take a look: https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD. We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities <U+0097> and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come.. This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone <U+0097> including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies <U+0097> has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/yMzAz3NU5u. To all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. We owe you. We can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this I can promise you: we will never forget. #MemorialDay https://t.co/b5vDrYiPL5. The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn<U+0092>t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.. Climate change poses an existential threat to our future <U+0097> and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.. Hunger today isn<U+0092>t about scarcity <U+0097> it<U+0092>s about a massive failure in leadership. 

If I were President, I<U+0092>d immediately work with @chefjoseandres to empower our restaurants to be part of the solution as families go hungry during the COVID-19 crisis. https://t.co/dGqSDgqXpM. We<U+0092>re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is trying to prevent people from getting health care. https://t.co/B46LlVfWaL. Folks write letters to me asking all kinds of questions, but Jack's question on my favorite ice cream flavor might be the best one yet.

Here<U+0092>s what I told him: https://t.co/GGlLFK1Q6S https://t.co/Hd5lTk1SlM. Make no mistake: I believe our best days still lie ahead. We can and will transform this nation <U+0097> together.. Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost, and tens of millions are out of work.

Meanwhile, the president spent his day golfing. https://t.co/H1BVNtgVjA. As Ramadan draws to an end, @DrBiden and I want to wish a safe and warm celebration to our Muslim friends and neighbors. Even though we can't be all together to celebrate, we hope it is filled with joy, family, and success for the year to come. #EidMubarak. This is jarring <U+0097> and a heartbreaking reminder that the death toll we see in the news is so much more than just a statistic. Every single one marks a future cut short and a family and community that will never be the same. @DrBiden and I are keeping them all in our hearts. https://t.co/4yJzsRdB6l. Donald Trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. It<U+0092>s unacceptable.

I<U+0092>ll make meaningful investments in Indian Country <U+0097> including increasing funding for Indian Health Services and making that funding mandatory. https://t.co/JIObym7aXI. The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It<U+0092>s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.. 36,000 Americans could be alive today if President Trump had acted sooner. Let's put that into perspective: https://t.co/i2bmqRe86r. We're in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetime, and Senate Republicans continue to delay relief for the American people saying, ""I don<U+0092>t see the need right now."" Unbelievable.

We've got to take back the Senate this November. https://t.co/ij73z7Oq9P. Adi is an incredible young advocate for the transgender community. He also graduated high school today. We wanted to say congrats...with a couple friends! https://t.co/1bDml2YI8Q. Think of how many small businesses could have been helped with the $47 million that went to private jet companies owned by wealthy Trump donors. It<U+0092>s ridiculous.

We need a president who puts hardworking Americans ahead of the wealthy and well-connected. https://t.co/A7Pn17J6id. In announcing the intent to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, President Trump has doubled down on his short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership. https://t.co/mbO2EBCYJu. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: No company pulling in billions of dollars in profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.

It's time for Amazon to pay its fair share. https://t.co/rsfBvcjqvX. In the middle of this crisis, President Trump is trying to cut food assistance. It<U+0092>s morally bankrupt.

We should do everything in our power to ensure no one goes hungry in America.. It didn<U+0092>t have to be this bad. The hard truth is that Donald Trump failed to take action, and it cost American lives. https://t.co/qhkliK1i5Z. I<U+0092>m looking forward to joining my friend @StephenAtHome on the @colbertlateshow tonight. Check out some of my favorite moments from the last time I was on his show <U+0097> and then make sure to tune in to CBS at 11:35 PM ET. https://t.co/KfG0ilRVqI. I don't usually Google myself, but I made an exception for @WIRED<U+0092>s Autocomplete Interview. Check it out: https://t.co/viqeb85Kjm. While we hope to soon return to some sense of normalcy in our lives, we cannot allow ourselves to return to the everyday gun violence that has plagued our past. We need to pass common-sense reforms and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/mJGGDWg54B. I promise you this: A Biden Administration will listen to scientists and heed their advice <U+0097> not silence them. https://t.co/hV4HPOmGDV. When I launched my campaign, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation <U+0097> we<U+0092>re seeing that soul on full display. Folks are reaching out to help one another and doing truly heroic things. It makes me so proud.. This shouldn<U+0092>t be a partisan issue. We need to ensure every single eligible American can safely make their voice heard this November. https://t.co/x7S9vkYwUI. Donald Trump is using a global health crisis as an excuse to deport children and continue separating families. It's heartless and un-American. People across the political spectrum rejected these policies before, and will do so again, because they know families belong together. https://t.co/xhd4PmvJsi. Folks, I<U+0092>m excited to share that we<U+0092>re hosting a grassroots fundraiser with @PeteButtigieg. Grassroots donors are the backbone of our campaign <U+0097> and I want to thank you for all your support.

Chip in any amount to join us Friday afternoon: https://t.co/B6JZ1XXuyz.

From my home in Delaware to Milwaukee, Wisconsin <U+0097> join us for a virtual rally at 3:30 PM CT: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/5vYn55VS6R. Donald Trump has failed to provide for our nurses and doctors on the frontlines. Now he<U+0092>s short-changing our troops and their families. Unacceptable. https://t.co/Q3s1MvHwQX. When we emerge from this crisis, we can<U+0092>t just go back to the way things were before. We need to take this country to a place we<U+0092>ve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream.. Congratulations to Dr. @iingwen on the start of her second term. Taiwan<U+0092>s thriving democracy and response to COVID-19 are an example to the world. America<U+0092>s support for Taiwan must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan. https://t.co/82aw9TFh8z. The United States of America has always emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation <U+0097> and we will again. We will overcome this.. Fundamentally, this is about whose side the government is on and whether it is accountable to the American people. This is a case I will continue to make, and if elected president will deliver on. https://t.co/x19ZeMOz4v. That's exactly why @EWarren and I have called for more oversight. We need more conditions on corporations to ensure relief goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No $500 billion slush fund. No blank checks. The Trump Administration is prioritizing big corporations over workers.. During today<U+0092>s Senate Banking Committee hearing, Secretary @StevenMnuchin1 refused to require corporations benefiting from $500 billion in CARES Act funds to keep workers on their payrolls. @EWarren asked him several times, each time he ducked and refused.. Today, @DrBiden and I are mourning the death of our dear friend, Annie Glenn. Her long life was filled with great love and great meaning, with purpose and her own brand of uncommon courage. https://t.co/JnAuBlF41P. Tonight, I'll be joining @chefjoseandres for a virtual town hall to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on food security and the restaurant industry <U+0097> and what our government should be doing to ensure no one in America goes hungry.

Watch live at 7 PM ET: https://t.co/KG9y39EA8s. I am proud to stand with @NationalNurses in calling for a strong OSHA standard for RNs and other frontline health care workers and full utilization of the Defense Production Act to mass produce personal protective equipment. https://t.co/ilhcLlB2Ws. It<U+0092>s time we reward the people who actually make this country work. Not Wall Street CEOs <U+0097> but the middle class. Ordinary women and men who are capable of doing extraordinary things when given half a chance.

That's who I'll fight for every single day in the White House.. Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus. But he does bear full responsibility for failing to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.. With your help, we'll defeat Donald Trump. And we won't just rebuild this nation <U+0097> we<U+0092>ll transform it. I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today to help make it happen: https://t.co/Wje8LYRL0J. One of President Trump's top advisors admitted that this administration ""really let the country down"" on testing.

He's right. It's long past time for Trump to step up and implement a national testing strategy so we can begin safely reopening the economy. https://t.co/jDawbgdAzl. - Expand vote-by-mail and early voting
- Implement online voter registration
- Ensure everyone can safely vote in-person

We need to do everything in our power to ensure every American can safely make their voice heard this November.. Companies getting relief from taxpayers have an obligation to protect workers' paychecks, and the Trump Administration has an obligation to hold their feet to the fire to ensure they do.

We need real relief paired with real oversight<U+0097>not no-strings-attached corporate bailouts. https://t.co/N7MlkNODqh. Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history <U+0097> and his recovery efforts are making that clearer than ever.. In the middle of the worst public health crisis in our lifetime, President Trump is actively trying to terminate health insurance for millions of Americans. It's unthinkable.

Here's what I would do to ensure everyone has access to the coverage they need: https://t.co/7kvok6B6if. In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. It's who we are. And it's how we're going to get through this <U+0097> together.. A year ago today, the House passed the #EqualityAct, a long-overdue bill that would ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated with dignity and respect under the law. But @SenateMajLdr won't bring it up for a vote. It's unacceptable.

Passing it will be a top legislative priority of mine.. I'm incredibly grateful for everyone who has chipped in to help fuel this campaign <U+0097> especially in times as tough as these. @EWarren and I called a few folks to thank them for their support: https://t.co/FPpttl2wkc. As we reflect on the incredible legacy of Brown v. Board of Education, we<U+0092>re reminded of the urgent work that remains before us 66 years later. We can<U+0092>t rest until every kid gets a fair shot, and we finally live up to our founding ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all.. Moments of crisis require presidents to step up, transcend partisan politics, and unite the nation to achieve a common goal. But Donald Trump has done nothing but stoke division<U+0097>and we're seeing the effect every day. He is the worst possible person to lead us through this crisis. https://t.co/PEArBTK2id. No graduating class gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but few have ever entered at a point in this country's history where they genuinely have a chance to write a new chapter.

Congratulations to the class of 2020, I can't wait to see the future you create. https://t.co/rfdhDJzBjO. Behind every COVID-19 death is a family and a community that will never be the same.

Behind every unemployment claim is a life thrown into uncertainty <U+0097> a person wondering how they<U+0092>ll make ends meet.

There is a real human toll to this crisis. We cannot forget that.. Today, on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, I stand with LGBTQ+ people and their allies to celebrate and champion the inherent dignity and worth of all persons<U+0097>regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. #IDAHOTB https://t.co/olR352jHqu. Congratulations to the Class of 2020 and to all those who were a part of the journey. I can't wait to see what you all accomplish. #GraduateTogether https://t.co/o95zNBsv8V. From this moment of crisis, we have the opportunity to not just rebuild our economy <U+0097> but transform it.. Defeating Donald Trump is going to take everything we've got. His campaign has been preparing for the last four years and has millions in the bank. I know times are tough, but if you can, please pitch in today to help us catch up: https://t.co/J626xObksn https://t.co/6hXpIM3cF6. On this Armed Forces Day, @DrBiden and I want to express our gratitude and support for the men and women in uniform <U+0097> serving and defending our country around the world. Thank you for your selfless service and sacrifice. You continue to make us proud. https://t.co/CHDdzrZkhK. I want Donald Trump to look the American people in the eye and explain why their hard-earned dollars are bailing out his wealthy donors. https://t.co/7FItXvsZpp. We're building a campaign that will defeat Donald Trump and transform this nation <U+0097> but we need your help to do it. Join us this Sunday for a Grassroots Strategy Summit, where we'll lay out our path to victory and how you can get involved: https://t.co/FhQWfR6nJf https://t.co/VuEkunPtr2. Unions like @GoIUPAT are supporting their workers and communities during this pandemic. To build a stronger, more inclusive, and more resilient middle class after this crisis, we must encourage unionization. That starts with enacting the PRO Act. https://t.co/JbZbXnGHfx. Los fracasos internacionales de Trump han abierto el camino para que Cuba se una al Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Esto traiciona a los presos pol<ed>ticos en Cuba y mina a<fa>n m<e1>s la diplomacia de los EE.UU. Como presidente, defender<e9> los derechos humanos del pueblo cubano.. Trump's international failures have cleared a path for Cuba to join the UN Human Rights Council. This would betray Cuba's political prisoners and further undermine U.S. diplomacy. As President, I will lead by empowering the Cuban people and defending human rights.. To everyone who has lost a loved one due to COVID-19: I know it's incredibly difficult right now, but there will come a time when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. It will take time, but that<U+0092>s when you know you<U+0092>re going to make it. https://t.co/bGyr3AIbWH.

- We end our gun violence epidemic
- We lead the world in combating climate change
- Everyone has access to the health care they need
- Our government works for all <U+0097> not just the wealthy and well-connected. To all of our front line workers who are working day in and day out to keep our nation afloat during this crisis, thank you.. We are months into this crisis. There is simply no excuse for President Trump's failure to implement a national testing strategy.. Tonight, @StaceyAbrams and I will be joining @Lawrence for a discussion on combating COVID-19 and how we can ensure everyone can make their voice heard this November.

Tune in to @MSNBC at 10 PM ET to watch live. https://t.co/yRr0RJRiu5.

Sherian, a small business owner from South Carolina, recently asked how I would help businesses like hers recover from this crisis and how we can tackle health care disparities among communities of color. They're important questions. Here's what I said: https://t.co/5gfIxhmIoG. The lives of tens of millions of Americans have been thrown into chaos through no fault of their own <U+0097> and Donald Trump simply isn't doing enough to help them. https://t.co/l9dIMOD2aK. Join me for a virtual roundtable on COVID-19 with Governors Gretchen Whitmer, Phil Murphy and Ned Lamont who are at the forefront of this crisis: https://t.co/qMB1AT6ST1. Small businesses are the backbone of this country. We have to do so much more to support them through this crisis. Here's what I would do if I were president: https://t.co/bXq5WtrytM. With the void of leadership in the White House, governors across the country have stepped up to meet this moment. This afternoon, I<U+0092>ll be joined by a few of them for a roundtable discussion on COVID-19. 

Tune in at 3:30 PM ET to watch: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/1EONVfE0pk. As the economy continues to spiral downwards and unemployment soars to Great Depression-era levels, we cannot ignore the hard truth: This crisis hit us harder and will take longer to recover from because of Donald Trump<U+0092>s failures. https://t.co/PYVWy6yG2w. There's nothing that the American people cannot accomplish when we stand together <U+0097> one nation, united in purpose.. <U+0093>60 days into the coronavirus crisis, the White House does not have a plan, a framework, a philosophy, or a goal.<U+0094>

Real presidents lead. Reality TV presidents don<U+0092>t. https://t.co/hn7GkkPv5Y. Not only does the Trump Administration want to take away health coverage for millions in the middle of a pandemic, but now they want to let people go hungry, too. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds. https://t.co/12JpuMOXEH. Moments of crisis require swift and decisive action from our leaders, but Donald Trump and his administration have done nothing but dither and delay. They have failed the American people on every single front. https://t.co/Bl4104WqEG. I would trust the guy who<U+0092>s one of our nation's top public health experts, not the one who pondered injecting disinfectant into the body and looked directly at a solar eclipse. https://t.co/nMJz1nogpW. Enough with the anger and division and fear-mongering, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up, appeal to our better angels, and unite the country. We'll overcome this crisis by coming together <U+0097> not by tearing each other apart. https://t.co/jySlLNWoHG. It didn<U+0092>t have to be this bad. Donald Trump utterly failed to prepare for this pandemic and delayed in taking the necessary steps to safeguard our nation against the near-worst-case-economic scenario we are now living. https://t.co/oFOuf4GbeB. We owe so much to every single worker on the front lines of this crisis. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. Here's what I would do if I were president: https://t.co/DBDyKVHt1m. I joined @PeterHamby on @Snapchat<U+0092>s Good Luck America to discuss everything from memes to stimulus oversight. Head to https://t.co/JKWnILB7To to watch the interview today, Thursday, and Friday.. A united party is key to winning the White House this November. The work of the task forces will be essential to identifying ways to build on our progress and not simply turn the clock back to a time before Donald Trump <U+0097> but transform our country. https://t.co/Ps5dztgjrX. Donald Trump can put up all of the banners he wants in the Rose Garden, but it doesn<U+0092>t change the fact that he failed our nation when it comes to COVID-19 testing. https://t.co/GDPuOAxndd. I wish the president would spend less time talking and tweeting and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci. This isn<U+0092>t politics. This is life and death. https://t.co/kJb8dYhf1B. .@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Aimee Stephens. We send our deepest condolences to her wife, Donna, and her family. Aimee's spirit and courage will not only be her legacy but our guiding light as we carry on her fight for equality. https://t.co/F9cAnGh6VC. The Trump Administration clearly knows what's needed to make workplaces safe and operational: adequate testing, contact tracing, masks, and additional precautions.

They're putting in the work to keep themselves safe. Why aren't they doing the same for the American people? https://t.co/VB8QbqQAqX. This is a bunch of malarkey and you know it, @senatemajldr. We left a 69-page playbook on how to fight pandemics.

You can read it here if you<U+0092>d like: https://t.co/zvRGv6ubWt

And make sure to pass along your notes to President Trump. He could use them. https://t.co/CooyBemPSv. Donald Trump knew about this crisis all the way back in January <U+0097> and his response since has been incompetent at best. https://t.co/OgVj8ia8Lk. Here's the deal: We can choose who our country works for. We can choose whether it works for just the wealthy <U+0097> or everyone else as well.

That<U+0092>s the choice we must make <U+0097> all of us together <U+0097> this November.. Let me be clear: My Administration will review every single stimulus loan given to big companies and political insiders. We will find any dollar taken corruptly, we will come get it, and we will punish the wrongdoers. https://t.co/UVQILUeTVN. Donald Trump just doesn't understand: We have an economic crisis because we have a public health crisis <U+0097> and we have a public health crisis because he failed to act. https://t.co/hRrueGgx2C. In April, we raised $60.5 million between my campaign and @TheDemocrats. I'm humbled and know what a sacrifice it is to give in times as difficult as these. But May is our most important month yet, and we need your help. If you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/HbZYJWVJUs. Donald Trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. So why are they insisting that it<U+0092>s unnecessary for the American people?. With folks staying at home during this time of social distancing, we put together some fun activities to keep everyone entertained. Text FREE to 30330 to be the first to get a look at what we<U+0092>ve been working on. https://t.co/7dDXj3dPCm. Donald Trump hopes to split us into dueling camps, casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.

It<U+0092>s a childish tactic<U+0097>and a false choice none of us should fall for. https://t.co/Kr8CYerAT3. I have a better idea: give people coronavirus economic relief and don't hold their hard-earned benefits hostage. https://t.co/b8cT22xGfd. This crisis presents an opportunity to not just rebuild our economy <U+0097> but transform it. @AndrewYang joined me to discuss how we can do that and create a stronger, fairer, more inclusive middle class.

Listen to the full episode: https://t.co/lQ9ghwJVgt https://t.co/3GaBdN1S46. No podemos callar ante la violencia contra personas transg<e9>nero de color, como las recientes tragedias en Missouri y Puerto Rico. Es nuestra obligaci<f3>n garantizar que todos puedan vivir abiertamente, con orgullo y sin miedo. https://t.co/CPmqT4kYxe. We cannot be silent in the face of rising violence against transgender people of color<U+0097>like the recent tragedies in Missouri and Puerto Rico. It's our moral obligation to end this epidemic, and ensure everyone can live open and proud and free from fear. https://t.co/CPmqT4kYxe. .@AndrewYang and I covered a lot of ground on the next episode of Here's the Deal, but the most surprising part might have been learning about his connection to the Roosevelts.

Make sure to tune in for the full episode tomorrow morning: https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo https://t.co/oYcWnZXWM8. Don't let anyone tell you differently: We have the power to write the future we want for our country.. Tax cuts for the super-wealthy.
Bailouts for large corporations.
Working Americans left behind.

That<U+0092>s Donald Trump<U+0092>s record. https://t.co/5ThHy2Gqdx. I believe rebuilding the middle class is the moral obligation of our time. We have to build a stronger, more inclusive, more resilient middle class <U+0097> one that can withstand the next public health crisis or whatever else comes our way. https://t.co/wxXgzR0U9I. Ordinary people, given half a chance, have never let their country down.

That<U+0092>s who I believe in. That<U+0092>s who I<U+0092>m in this race to fight for.. To the extraordinary mothers everywhere, like Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, my wishes for a safe and happy Mother<U+0092>s<U+00A0>Day. https://t.co/3PmotUx6EU. There's a clear choice this November:

Donald Trump will do everything he can to terminate health care for millions in a global pandemic.

I will do everything I can to ensure every American has access to the quality, affordable care they need. https://t.co/ziqbBhFmzU. There<U+0092>s no quit in America. None at all. We<U+0092>re going to get through this <U+0097> and we're going to come out stronger.. Imagine what we could be doing now with the $2 trillion in tax cuts that Donald Trump delivered for his rich friends. https://t.co/5yDjitm4l2. We need to rebuild the backbone of this country <U+0097> the middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along.

We have to make sure every single person gets a fair shot at success.. Ahmaud Arbery was shot down in cold blood. His family deserves justice <U+0097> and they deserve it now. https://t.co/YkXBvYIJNw. Make no mistake: COVID-19 has caused a massive economic challenge. But this crisis hit us harder, and will last longer, because Donald Trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength. https://t.co/4nkrpNDXgs. Two years ago, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran Deal. This week, he vetoed a war powers resolution that would've prevented him from starting a war with Iran without Congressional consent. His decisions have increased the risk of war in the Middle East. https://t.co/Tq0CU99A1r. Corruption is a feature of Donald Trump's economic agenda<U+0097>not a bug. He will pick his wealthy friends and corporate cronies over working families every time.

I say it<U+0092>s time we pick a different way<U+0097>one where everyone gets a fair shot at success, not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. https://t.co/9MbZpSblC5. 75 years ago on #VEDay, America and its allies defeated fascism in Europe. From the devastation of war, we built a lasting peace. Today, as we honor the veterans who sacrificed for us, let us remember the importance of uniting against common threats.. I<U+0092>m the proud husband of a teacher who inspires me every day. I<U+0092>ve seen firsthand how hard teachers work with little support and few resources. Thank you to all the amazing teachers who've inspired and educated the future of our country. #TeacherAppreciationWeek https://t.co/1sq1isIOWr. Donald Trump loves to crow about what a great economy he built.

This crisis has revealed what a failure Trumponomics has been. And American workers and families are paying the price. 

Tune in for my remarks live on @nowthisnews at 12 PM EDT.. Here's the simple truth: The United States of America has never been defeated when we're together <U+0097> and we're not going to be defeated now.

We can and will overcome this.. I can't hit the campaign trail in-person due to COVID-19 <U+0097> so instead, I<U+0092>m traveling across the country from my home in Delaware. Head over to my Instagram to catch up on today<U+0092>s trip to Florida <U+0001F4F2>.. Every step of the way, President Trump has ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people <U+0097> and we<U+0092>re all paying the price every single day.

I promise you, I will do the opposite. https://t.co/lok9PvaaFJ. Over 33 million Americans have filed unemployment claims since mid-March <U+0097> one out of every five workers. It<U+0092>s a national economic disaster that requires urgent action. We have to get help to everyone who needs it <U+0097> efficiently, equitably, and immediately. https://t.co/6wOUCo8Dj8. I believe the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild our economy in a way that finally brings everyone along. A Biden Administration will encourage the economic empowerment of African Americans and close the racial wealth and income gaps.

Read more: https://t.co/Ni1rAmqfcz. These folks are true heroes <U+0097> every single one of them.

Take a minute to read their stories: https://t.co/BU2eCifWhZ. We can't host any in-person events due to COVID-19, but that won't stop me from hitting the campaign trail<U+0097>virtually, of course. Tomorrow, I'll be making stops around Florida and wrapping up the day with a virtual rally in Tampa.

Tune in at 5:15 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/H3ZAyxhxxj. I<U+0092>ve said it before, and I<U+0092>ll say it again: No one is expendable. No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.. The nurses on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe, emergency paid sick leave, and premium pay. #NationalNursesDay. You heard it straight from the president himself: He wants to terminate health care for millions of Americans in the middle of a global pandemic.

We can't let that happen. https://t.co/OD1rdn8yiz. The stakes in this election have never been higher. Over the last few months, we've seen how wholly unfit Donald Trump is to lead our nation.

We have to vote him out of the White House this November.. We can<U+0092>t sit by as Donald Trump and Republicans use COVID-19 as an excuse to disenfranchise voters. We need to ensure people have the opportunity to vote by mail, early vote, vote absentee and, in every way possible, safely vote in person this November. https://t.co/uKRyR3LVTA. Today, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump-backed lawsuit to dismantle the ACA enters a new phase. If Trump and Republican AGs succeed, it<U+0092>ll mean devastation for our health care system that will cause untold pain and suffering. We can't let that happen. https://t.co/TVb3TIKsny. These stories are heartbreaking and remind us that the numbers we see in the news are more than just statistics. Every death is a tragedy and marks a family and community that will never be the same. @DrBiden and I are keeping them all in our prayers. 
https://t.co/ajYHuY6VN2. The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood. My heart goes out to his family, who deserve justice and deserve it now. It is time for a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his murder. https://t.co/alvY5WjdHx. This didn't have to happen. The Trump Administration failed to take action and produce desperately needed protective equipment <U+0097> and those on the front lines of this crisis paid the price. It's heartbreaking. https://t.co/7bOj3POJCT. The choice between the economy and public health is a false one<U+0097>if we don<U+0092>t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives. We have to get the number of new cases down and scale up testing before we return to some sense of normalcy. https://t.co/N7UT3WtNPK. It<U+0092>s important to stay connected while we<U+0092>re social distancing <U+0097> but there<U+0092>s always that one friend who doesn<U+0092>t get the hint when it<U+0092>s time to end the video chat. 

Glad we don<U+0092>t know anyone like that <U+0097> right, @KeeganMKey? https://t.co/AoDEYRTo8G. It's been a big few weeks. President Obama, Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and Speaker Pelosi all endorsed our campaign. Now, we need your help to keep the momentum going.

I know times are tough, but if you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/D4S84E6v2Z. Each week, I get hundreds of letters from people across the country. Folks share their hopes, ideas, struggles, and concerns <U+0097> and I try to respond to as many as I can. We're going to share a few of them with you in our new series: Sincerely, Joe. https://t.co/HOHwdCcY1h. Thank you to all the:

Firefighters
Paramedics
Police officers
Doctors
Nurses
Medical support staff
Grocery and retail workers
Meatpackers
Delivery drivers
Transit workers
And everyone else on the front lines of this fight.

You truly are the heart and soul of this country.. Let me be clear: Essential workers on the front lines of this crisis deserve premium pay, emergency paid sick leave, and protections that keep them safe.. Across the country, folks are stepping up, taking care of their neighbors, and lending a hand to those in need. It's who we are. In times of crisis, we stand as one. And it makes me so proud to be an American. https://t.co/nXxczgOfAZ. Today, I<U+0092>m releasing a new plan to achieve equity for the African American community and take us one step closer to making America what it ought to be. Read more: https://t.co/ub49jLMI9M. Over 1 million cases of COVID-19. Almost 70,000 dead. What is upsetting President Trump? Tough questions from the press.

Cry me a river, Mr. President. https://t.co/MbSZJ0UMel. Make no mistake: We can emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. It<U+0092>s within our power <U+0097> we just need a president and an administration who are up for the task.. I've always believed that we've been at our best when we've acted as one America. This crisis is an opportunity for us to be that nation again. There's not a single thing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.. In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. https://t.co/QikZiHZeXX. The hard truth is that it didn<U+0092>t have to be this bad. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately <U+0097> all of it stems from Donald Trump<U+0092>s failures as president. https://t.co/d7XZvkJKXP. This Sunday night, settle in and join labor leader Dolores Huerta, actor John Leguizamo, Secretary Hilda Solis, and Congresswoman Escobar for a #TodosConBiden discussion. Tune in now: https://t.co/o7qCPrYivT. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this <U+0097> together.. Donald Trump seems to think he can direct funding based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he<U+0092>s trying to win in November, and which businesses he wants to enrich <U+0097> all without any accountability. @EWarren and I think that<U+0092>s unacceptable. https://t.co/wbEcnkBzj1. This #WorldPressFreedomDay, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. We must vote Trump out this November and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable <U+0097> especially not in the White House. https://t.co/Ga8zWYphOg. Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.. A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it<U+0092>s why Donald Trump<U+0092>s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.. The U.S. Postal Service is an essential pillar of American life. We simply cannot let Donald Trump destroy it. https://t.co/1W4W6LkMum. Over the last few weeks, I worked with our supporters and staff to create a code for our campaign<U+0097>the principles we<U+0092>ll live by, reflecting the community we<U+0092>ve built, the team we aspire to be, and some of my own <U+0091>rules<U+0092> as well.

I<U+0092>m excited to share it: https://t.co/odsoUFxPmd https://t.co/ulwQwEosTz. This pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. This moment requires all of us to come together <U+0097> across the nation and around the world <U+0097> to solve this crisis.. When I say Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history, this is what I'm talking about.

Monty Bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it. https://t.co/CV5NqlreSs. We left a playbook. He ignored it.

We created an office to prepare for pandemics. He gutted it.

We had CDC officials in China to detect and contain outbreaks. He pulled them out.

Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared. https://t.co/NdsINZ307m. Mi coraz<f3>n y el de Jill est<e1>n con Puerto Rico a ra<ed>z de los terremotos de hoy. Mientras la isla enfrenta el impacto de este suceso y la pandemia del COVID-19 tenemos que asegurarnos que reciban los recursos y la asistencia que necesitan para recuperarse lo m<e1>s pronto posible.. My heart and Jill's are with the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. As the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible.. To @USWNT: don<U+0092>t give up this fight. This is not over yet.

To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding. https://t.co/XK6t9oM94k. On March 6th, Donald Trump said: <U+0093>Anybody that wants a test can get a test.<U+0094>

It was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.

This administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide.. I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America. The president should encourage folks to follow Gov. Whitmer<U+0092>s public health orders <U+0097> not sow further discord and division. https://t.co/fZrHELiXVh. As we mark the beginning of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, @DrBiden and I extend our best wishes to AANHPI communities across America. We look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead.. When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. We have to build a better future for all.

We can and will transform this nation <U+0097> together.. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn<U+0092>t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That<U+0092>s not me. As a Presidential candidate, I<U+0092>m accountable to the American people. https://t.co/Wm1666LF8A. We need more tests. Our front line workers need protective equipment. Americans need additional economic relief.

Yet the Trump Administration is spending time and energy on President Trump's wasteful border wall.

Unbelievable. https://t.co/RY12LJAYGS. The number is overwhelming, but each one represents a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, and a community worried about how it will recover.

We have to do more to help them. Now. https://t.co/TBtbqj5Kbw. - More than 60,000 people in the U.S. have died
- 30 million have filed for unemployment
- At least 1 million have gotten sick

Enough with the late night Twitter tantrums, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and lead.. Instead of preparing our country to fight COVID-19, Donald Trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by April.

He was wrong. And we're all paying the price. https://t.co/R0tDbI1WZr. An open and independent press is more important than ever in times like this. They deserve to be treated with respect <U+0097> not belittled with schoolyard taunts from this president. https://t.co/eIiJO6uJfr. Donald Trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings, or didn't read them at all. Either way, it's a complete and unjustifiable dereliction of duty. https://t.co/LVzlxWFTAd. I<U+0092>ve been a big fan of Megan<U+0092>s for years and can<U+0092>t wait to join her this afternoon. You can watch our chat live at 2:45 PM ET: https://t.co/RQzAg1XvVf https://t.co/tLxJeqr1w3. The climate emergency isn't just a threat to our environment, it's a threat to our health, economy, and so much more. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action to combat it before it's too late. https://t.co/08paP9Ii3C. In the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is still working to gut the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.

They need to drop the lawsuit immediately. https://t.co/yc6azeqLVs. With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions.. The words of a president matter <U+0097> and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19, pass blame onto others, and mislead the American people. I will do the opposite. https://t.co/6ZViv3tdW7. The Trump Admin failed to provide enough testing, PPE, and safety enforcement. Workers have gotten sick, plants have closed, and the meat supply is at risk. It's past time workers have the protections they need to stay healthy and do their job safely. https://t.co/tD0Rc7P4mJ. ""I wish he were president right now, but I can't wait until he is if all of us do our part to support the kind of person that we want back in the White House."" <U+0097> @HillaryClinton

Join us: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW https://t.co/xyy85Q0R6e. Wear a mask in public.
Read your daily briefings.
Listen to the experts.

This really isn't rocket science. It's common sense.. We owe a profound debt of gratitude to the health care workers on the front lines of this fight. I checked in with Monica, an ICU Nurse, to talk about how she's getting through this and to thank her for all she's doing: https://t.co/PLuEZWO5aQ. I couldn't agree with @HillaryClinton more. We need a president who will listen to the science, bring us together, and lead with compassion and heart. If I have the honor of being elected, that's the exact kind of president I will be. https://t.co/g7z1C8SH7e. There are nearly 330 million people in the United States <U+0097> and according to the Trump White House, we've only conducted 5.4 million COVID-19 tests. It's abysmal.

Donald Trump needs to scale up testing, and he needs to do it immediately.. Let me be very clear: No one is expendable.

We shouldn<U+0092>t allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability.. The fact is there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. If we had listened to the experts and heeded their warnings, it could have been stopped short. But Donald Trump failed to act <U+0097> and now the American people are paying the price. https://t.co/oXeANYvD7T. I<U+0092>ve known @HillaryClinton for years, and know that her dedication and passion for bettering our country are second to none. I<U+0092>m grateful for her endorsement and for her friendship <U+0097> and look forward to working alongside her to get Donald Trump out of the White House. https://t.co/rv3BuW2BUx. COVID-19 is affecting the entire nation, but the impact doesn<U+0092>t look the same for everyone. I'm hosting a town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting women <U+0097> and I'll be joined by special guest Hillary Clinton. Tune in now to watch: https://t.co/sQBaHGHgRQ. We're months into this crisis and workers still don't have enough protective equipment, there still aren't enough tests, and the death toll continues to rise.

The President should spend less time congratulating himself and more time doing his job. https://t.co/lVJAcHySwH. We are months into this crisis, and health care workers still don<U+0092>t have the protective equipment they need. It<U+0092>s a national disgrace. https://t.co/WnSdlPfJYR. Tomorrow afternoon, I'll be hosting a town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting women <U+0097> and I'll be joined by a special guest. Tune in at 3 PM ET to watch: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/nw44aea7UP. The Trump Administration could have helped prevent this. But once again, they failed to take action <U+0097> and now the American people are paying the price. https://t.co/OzNIJpxn2k. Testing is the springboard we need to help get our economy safely up and running again. Trump could rapidly scale it up. He hasn<U+0092>t. Instead, he<U+0092>s passed blame and pushed sole responsibility to governors.

We've got to do better. https://t.co/qtjjC5shEJ. COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together as one America <U+0097> not by targeting others.

Thank you for helping lead this fight, @AndrewYang. https://t.co/2rFQ9mKkjm. Join Senator Kamala Harris and Symone Sanders for a town hall addressing the impact and disparities of COVID-19 in the Black community. Tune in now: https://t.co/coThZJGoej. COVID-19 can hit anyone, anywhere <U+0097> but it doesn<U+0092>t affect every community equally. This afternoon, join Senator @KamalaHarris and @SymoneDSanders for a discussion on its disproportionate impact on communities of color.

Tune in at 3:30 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/lzco7XHP53. We want our country to get moving and healthy again. But we must take the necessary, rational steps, grounded in science, to do so safely, so COVID-19 doesn<U+0092>t come roaring back. https://t.co/ivYeRgrf4q. I'm incredibly honored by @SpeakerPelosi's endorsement and grateful for her historic leadership in Congress. 

Together, we helped pass Obamacare and together we can not only bring this country back from the brink from this current crisis, but transform it. https://t.co/nJG599w7lU. America has always met every big challenge with an even bigger solution <U+0097> this moment should be no different. We need an infrastructure program that will combat climate change and create good-paying jobs at the same time.. Wealthy firms with ties to Trump got millions, while countless small businesses were turned away. No wonder he wanted no one to watch how the money was deployed.

The American people deserve rigorous oversight <U+0097> and small businesses deserve relief. Now. https://t.co/UNBLt4g5R9. The American people are stepping up and rising to meet this moment. It's time for our president to do the same.. Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction. https://t.co/RmUuKLc70X. Imagine the future we can build with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where:

- Health care is a right
- We combat climate change
- We end our gun violence epidemic
- Our government works for all <U+0097> not just the powerful

Let<U+0092>s build that future, together.. The workers on the front lines of this crisis are risking their lives every day to combat COVID-19 and keep this country running. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. https://t.co/cL67OThz8m. 366 days ago, we launched this campaign.

192 days from now, we<U+0092>ll beat Donald Trump.

Let<U+0092>s go win this thing, together. https://t.co/yDbpcKgXwZ. @carobrissett @pizzahut I bet this made their day. Thank you for stepping up and doing what you can to help those on the front lines of this fight.. @Emmieinthecity Michelle, this is a great idea. Thank you for doing what you can to ensure folks have the masks they need to stay safe.. @Im4fit Julie, I can<U+0092>t thank you enough for all you<U+0092>re doing to ensure folks have food and supplies during this crisis.. @a_zinsner8 @TeamJoe This is great, Addie. Tell your mom and sister I say thank you for lending a helping hand to your neighbors.. @AmandaLinton23 @templehospital Amanda, this is remarkable. Thank you for stepping up and supporting our front line heroes. I know the staff will greatly appreciate your donations.. Today, folks across the nation have showed their compassion by participating in our first ever #SOULSaturday.  Tune in now as we end the day with a celebration for our campaign<U+0092>s one year anniversary: https://t.co/69XYQrqkzx. One year ago, we launched this campaign. Whether you were on #TeamJoe from day one or have joined in recent weeks <U+0097> I<U+0092>m incredibly grateful for your support and hope I make you proud. Together, we<U+0092>re going to beat Donald Trump, unite this country, and transform our nation.. It<U+0092>s stories like these that make me so proud to be an American and make me confident that we will overcome this. Because there<U+0092>s nothing the American people have been unable to accomplish when we do it together.. After seeing the shortage of masks around the country, Marilyn decided to step up and organize efforts in Northern Virginia to make homemade masks. Because of her selfless work, countless front line workers have the masks they need to stay safe.. Older adults are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Recognizing that, Erica decided to organize youth in her community to buy groceries for seniors <U+0097> ensuring they receive the food they need while staying safe at home. She's a true hero.. Brien usually works at the Ford Plant in Rawsonville, Michigan, driving a semi. But when the plant started assembling much-needed ventilators, he courageously stepped up and volunteered to help. His selfless actions will no doubt save countless lives.. John, a Facilities Maintainer from Staten Island, recently contracted and survived the coronavirus. Shortly after he recovered, a colleague contracted the virus and needed plasma to battle it. John heroically stepped up and donated his plasma to help his coworker.. Across the country, people are stepping up and doing incredible things amid this pandemic. It<U+0092>s who we are as Americans<U+0097>in times of crisis, we stand as one.

Donald Trump needs to step up and do everything he can to give our front line workers the protective equipment they need. https://t.co/pSTfvFlyQ7.

Here<U+0092>s an idea, Mr. President: more tests. Now. And protective equipment for actual medical professionals. https://t.co/Zv4Mfs2Z4a. The words of a president matter <U+0097> never more than in times of crisis. A president should seek to calm and heal, provide a steady hand, and a clear path forward.

Instead, this is what we get from Donald Trump: https://t.co/0H5NTAqbY3. Donald Trump will always put his wealthy and well-connected friends first <U+0097> that should come as no surprise. But to allow the banks to do it on the backs of small business owners in the middle of a global pandemic is a new low <U+0097> even for him. https://t.co/tG1rVOeZxs. To celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting our first #SOULSaturday this weekend. Folks across the nation will be taking time to check-in on neighbors and thank those on the front lines of this fight.

Take a minute to read a few: https://t.co/sbiSVrBXhW. 26 million people unemployed. That's not just a statistic  <U+0097> every one is a life thrown into uncertainty. Every worker left wondering when they will next see a paycheck is part of this American crisis  <U+0097>  and Donald Trump isn't doing enough for them. https://t.co/fAzujTeMBI. Make no mistake: The climate crisis poses an existential threat to our future. But I know the American people have the spirit, power, and ingenuity to meet the challenge head-on. There<U+0092>s nothing we<U+0092>ve been unable to accomplish when we do it together.. Workers, like grocery store cashiers, are on the front lines of this crisis risking their lives every day to combat COVID-19 and keep this country running. President Trump is refusing to do his job, but we've got to do ours. Learn more: https://t.co/Cio6Bp8GYq #ShopSmart. We have the power to change the future of our planet <U+0097> and it starts at the ballot box this November. https://t.co/9COHq8TRZ8. This #EarthDay, let<U+0092>s recommit to doing everything in our power to combat climate change. That starts with voting Donald Trump out of the White House this November.. Fifty years ago, #EarthDay began as a day of organizing that demonstrated the power of community action. This year, it<U+0092>s also a reminder of everything that<U+0092>s on the line if we do not get Donald Trump out of the White House. https://t.co/IkZPE983fO. The climate emergency requires our urgent action. As president, I will:

We have to take drastic action before it<U+0092>s too late <U+0097> and that<U+0092>s exactly what I will do as president.

https://t.co/FbsOsz7VzW https://t.co/4KwlWtOibd. Folks, we just launched a special #EarthDay episode of Here's the Deal! Governor @JayInslee joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, climate change, and why he's supporting our campaign.

Listen to the full episode now: https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo https://t.co/DRJyrZ5njV. The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.

As of now, only 4 million have been completed. It<U+0092>s unacceptable.

We can<U+0092>t safely reopen the economy without scaling up testing, and we can<U+0092>t effectively scale up testing unless Donald Trump does his job.. The Paycheck Protection Program was intended to send help to the small businesses that needed it most, but President Trump adopted an approach to help his high-priced friends. We've got to do better.

Here's what I would do if I were president: https://t.co/NXMrGe56Pg. The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We need to immediately expand vote-by-mail, online voter registration, and early voting to ensure everyone can safely exercise their right to participate in our electoral process. https://t.co/An7O2h1t9M. I know COVID-19 is causing many people to feel anxious about what the future holds or lonely during this time of social distancing <U+0097> and that's okay, just know that you're not alone. I've asked my friend, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to share a few tips on how to get through this: https://t.co/Hx9TMlF2zP. This Holocaust Remembrance Day, as we remember the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime, we recommit to ensuring such atrocities never again occur. With anti-Semitism on the rise, all of us must root out intolerance and give hate no safe harbor.. Out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger <U+0097> and we will again. We will not be defeated.. I am honored to have the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, a leading environmental advocacy organization. Climate change is an existential threat, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity facing our country and our world. https://t.co/puvpCUScSn. In March alone, this campaign raised $46.7 million, with 70% from online donations. This virus has changed our campaign. But it hasn't changed the unwavering support we've gotten from all of you.

We have to come together to make Donald Trump a one-term president. Once we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation <U+0097> we will transform it and create a better future for all.. On this week<U+0092>s episode of Here<U+0092>s the Deal, Senator @AmyKlobuchar joins me for a discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted her family and what drove her to get involved in politics.

Listen to the full episode at: https://t.co/t11Fa0TZjc https://t.co/YaLgMAQNff. At a time when Trump is fanning the flames of white supremacy and hatred in our country, my heart is with the families of those we lost in the Oklahoma City bombing 25 years ago today.

We truly couldn't get through this without you. https://t.co/vr10U5pca6. No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. We'll listen to the experts and heed their advice. And I will always tell you the truth.. At a time when studies are linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality rates for the most vulnerable in our society, the Trump Administration is rolling back environmental protections <U+0097> allowing more poison into our air. https://t.co/047lsdtrQN. As Kierkegaard said, <U+0093>faith sees best in the dark.<U+0094> I've always believed that. This pandemic is keeping many communities apart, but we've still got to keep the faith. Jill and I are wishing a Happy Easter to all of the Orthodox Christians celebrating around the world. https://t.co/3gQVAOtdzk. The United States should be standing up for freedom and standing with the people of Hong Kong. Instead, Trump has said he's <U+0093>standing with Xi Jinping.<U+0094> That's weak. We need to be strong on values when it comes to China. That's what I'll do as president. https://t.co/O2o66tJFkY. I couldn't be prouder of my friends @LadyGaga and Chris Martin of @Coldplay for organizing the @GlblCtzn One World: #TogetherAtHome broadcast. We are all in this fight together <U+0097> and if we stand as one, we will defeat COVID-19. https://t.co/TLpW631qfR.

Tune in tomorrow at 7 PM ET to watch live: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/NEMjeyisJx. Donald Trump left our country unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime <U+0097> and now we're paying the price. https://t.co/aCxcqQqUqw. Donald Trump may not like it, but it's his responsibility to step up and lead our nation's testing strategy. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and returning to some semblance of normalcy. https://t.co/AYmwnMmDB4. Donald Trump continues to do the exact thing we teach our kids not to do: blame others. It<U+0092>s always somebody else's fault <U+0097> never his. It<U+0092>s unbelievable.

We deserve better from our commander in chief. https://t.co/ZNEDGwozyu. Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response.

Experts say that if we had acted two weeks earlier, more lives could have been saved.

Trump failed to take swift action<U+0097>and we're paying the price. https://t.co/nyq6DpLOid. President Trump is trying to rewrite history when it comes to China and COVID-19 <U+0097> but the facts don't back him up. Tony Blinken was the Deputy Secretary of State and is one of my top foreign policy advisors. He'll explain. https://t.co/si3vDHnF2r. The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic. He ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies and put his trust in China's leaders instead. Now, we're all paying the price.

Let me explain how we got here: https://t.co/esvCaGki9V. I know the American people will beat this. We<U+0092>re brave and big-hearted. We<U+0092>ve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation <U+0097> and we will again.. We<U+0092>re in the middle of a global pandemic. No one feeling ill should have to choose between earning a paycheck or staying home to recover. We need to provide paid sick leave to everyone who needs it immediately.. It's been a big week: President Obama, Senator Sanders, and Senator Warren all endorsed our campaign <U+0097> and we need your help to keep this momentum going.

I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today: https://t.co/xMh8n6xLAc. Today<U+0092>s news that more than 22 million people filed unemployment claims over the last month is devastating. It<U+0092>s clear more needs to be done to help hardworking Americans<U+0097>so I<U+0092>m calling for a bigger, bolder approach to keeping people on the job. Read more: https://t.co/r65WXgLKLz. These racist acts have got to stop. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where they or their ancestors come from, or who they are.

COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together<U+0097>not by targeting people of AAPI heritage. https://t.co/y8vYAQzvsW. Here's the simple truth: This nation has never been defeated when we're together <U+0097> and we're not going to be defeated now. We will overcome this. https://t.co/7Irkhnbf6I. When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were. We need to build a better future for all.. To combat COVID-19, we need a decisive public health response to curb its spread and a comprehensive economic response that delivers real relief to Americans.

I've released several plans outlining exactly what I would do if I were president. Take a look: https://t.co/YLHCGF1YM9. So this week, we<U+0092>re working through what ours will be. There are a few I know: compassion, kindness, humility, gratitude, and joy. But I want your help. Our supporters have been here from the start<U+0097>and I want to know: what should be in our campaign<U+0092>s code? https://t.co/UoRbb41RHD. We won<U+0092>t defeat this President by being like him. We<U+0092>ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we<U+0092>ll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we<U+0092>ll show compassion. And when he fights, we<U+0092>ll fight harder. But we can<U+0092>t do it without you.. Mayor @PeteButtigieg<U+0092>s campaign had a set of <U+0093>rules of the road<U+0094> that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. I think it<U+0092>s a good idea, and one I<U+0092>d like @TeamJoe to adopt.. In the Biden family, we have a code: My mom used to always tell me, <U+0093>Joey, no one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you.<U+0094> I<U+0092>m working on building one for our campaign, too.. Managing an economic relief and recovery effort is hard, painstaking work. The devil is in the details. It<U+0092>s all about follow-through.

I've done the work before, and I'll be ready to do it on day one as president. https://t.co/a7oCXZqCL2. Millions of folks are relying on the workers at the front lines of this crisis. I<U+0092>ll be talking to a few of them for our virtual town hall. Tune in: https://t.co/r3HMc7MpJs. This afternoon, I<U+0092>ll be hosting a virtual town hall with a few workers on the front lines of this crisis. Tune in at 3:00 PM ET to watch live: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/koBtR3Ahq7. COVID-19 is amplifying so many inequities in our society. We have to ensure support gets to those who need it immediately, and then do the necessary work to rip out the structural racism that creates these inequalities. https://t.co/fDUcAdfOHz. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I<U+0092>m proud to have the fiercest of fighters, Senator @EWarren, on my side. With her help, we<U+0092>re going to beat Donald Trump and create a government that works for everyone <U+0097> not just the wealthy and well-connected. Let<U+0092>s do this. https://t.co/X0G4AZta1S. I want Donald Trump to look these folks in the eye and explain to them why they or their loved ones haven<U+0092>t been able to get tested for COVID-19. We<U+0092>ve got to do better. https://t.co/CUY6nmCPjl. Millions of people are relying on the workers on the front lines of this crisis. Tomorrow, I<U+0092>ll be joined by a few of them for a virtual town hall. 

Tune in tomorrow at 3PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/KrSwKV84QT. Stories like this showcase exactly who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We help out folks we've never met, lift each other up, and do our part to ensure we make it through.

We will overcome this, together. https://t.co/fdOKwA3Iak. President Obama understands, as I do, that we will come through this crisis stronger. And then we<U+0092>ll not only rebuild this nation <U+0097> we will transform it. https://t.co/nlilxxpA91. Barack <U+0097> This endorsement means the world to Jill and me. We<U+0092>re going to build on the progress we made together, and there<U+0092>s no one I<U+0092>d rather have standing by my side. https://t.co/0mAjPZeYmd. Leadership is about never proclaiming power. It<U+0092>s about collaboration, it<U+0092>s about coming together in a crisis and finding common ground. It<U+0092>s about results.  

That<U+0092>s who I am and the role I aspire to fulfill in guiding this democratic nation to better times.. I am not running for office to be King of America. I respect the Constitution. I<U+0092>ve read the Constitution. I<U+0092>ve sworn an oath to it many times. I respect the great job so many of this country<U+0092>s governors <U+0097> Democratic and Republican <U+0097> are doing under these horrific circumstances. https://t.co/vMtcfD45mG. I want to congratulate @judgekarofsky on her hard-earned victory tonight. In the face of rampant voter suppression and GOP recklessness, the people of Wisconsin showed up and made their choice clear. I know Wisconsin will be a fairer, more just state with Jill on the court. https://t.co/Ch9PXnqekt. I am grateful to have the support of so many Wisconsinites and proud of the courage and commitment folks showed during last week's primary <U+0097> but it should never have come to that.

No one should ever have to choose between their health and our democracy. https://t.co/D4PpzYkter. For months, the Trump Administration was repeatedly warned about the threat COVID-19 posed to our nation. They ignored the experts, failed to take action, and now Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/YiSTQPnLNy. We<U+0092>re in the middle of a global pandemic. We need a president who actually listens to public health experts. https://t.co/A4LvRY36nY. To Bernie<U+0092>s supporters: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. 

I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome on this campaign. You<U+0092>re needed. https://t.co/vJXlroCdDd. I'm speaking now about our nation's economic response to COVID -- and I'll have a special guest with me. Tune in: https://t.co/VTJPX6da0v.

You can listen to the full episode at https://t.co/t11Fa0TZjc or wherever you get your podcasts. https://t.co/tXjopC10xz. We're facing a crisis unlike any we've faced before <U+0097> and I couldn't be prouder of how the American people are responding. https://t.co/wK1mDPDl9b. To everyone on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you.. As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration<U+0092>s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes. https://t.co/SkfH3U792L. Folks, we just released a special Sunday episode of Here<U+0092>s the Deal! @RevDrBarber joined me for a discussion on faith and its intersection with some of the most pressing issues we face as a nation.

Listen at https://t.co/t11Fa0CorE or wherever you get your podcasts. https://t.co/TJWyyWbVIC. This Easter, Jill and I wish all of you and your families a safe and joyful celebration, and we join our prayers with those of people from every faith for health, happiness, and a renewal of life in the year to come. https://t.co/i3ID9G3qv7. We are in the middle of a global pandemic <U+0097> and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.. This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise, the will, and the spirit to defeat it. There is nothing the American people can't accomplish if we work together.. We need to help as many working families and small businesses as possible. Workers who have lost their jobs or seen their hours slashed and families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table need help immediately. There's no time to waste. https://t.co/XFNZK6m1RV. We are months into this crisis and our heroes on the front lines still don't have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. It's unconscionable.

Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act immediately. https://t.co/wudATlE3wr. Now more than ever, we have to choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.. President Trump needs to do everything in his power to expand the number of testing sites and surge the number of tests. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and finding a way out of this crisis. https://t.co/WHprzHoGnm. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. There's nothing we can't do if we do it together.. No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to freeze rent for people who lose their jobs and place a ban on evictions immediately. https://t.co/0sQYpUHosv. We need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic  <U+0097>  including the spate of racist incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  <U+0097>  with urgency and seriousness. Donald Trump is not that president. https://t.co/4dvq4uiv17. La historia de los EE.UU. es la historia de gente com<fa>n que hace cosas extraordinarias. S<e9> que unidos, y como una naci<f3>n, nosotros somos m<e1>s fuertes que este virus. S<e9> que superaremos esto y seremos m<e1>s fuertes por ello, se lo prometo. No pierdan la fe. https://t.co/89o4gSMNWF. Whether you supported Bernie or any other candidate throughout the primary, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. You're not just welcome <U+0097> you're needed. And I will do everything I can to earn your vote this November.. America<U+0092>s story is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things given half a chance. This virus is tough. But together and as a nation <U+0097> we're tougher.

I know we<U+0092>ll get through this and we<U+0092>ll be stronger for it, I promise you. Keep the faith. https://t.co/dC8JvRWPMC. This virus can hit anyone <U+0097> regardless of race, economic status, or access to power <U+0097> but it doesn<U+0092>t impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources.

We have to do better for all our people. https://t.co/fx76CcIPdU. The devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: We need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast. We need to take extraordinary steps to protect American families and ensure those laid off are made financially whole. https://t.co/PBOyM1JiUu. This morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims<U+0097>on top of the millions already filed<U+0097>is devastating. We have to make sure those affected get the benefits they deserve, but we can't stop there.

I'm announcing two new policies to help Americans get the relief they need: https://t.co/fUlIB2Fra2. I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests <U+0097> not reducing them. Testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis. https://t.co/jj6ftCxVQt. We have to do more to ease the economic burden on working people. So today, I'm adopting two new policies to help deliver relief. As president, I will:

- Lower Medicare eligibility to age 60
- Forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families https://t.co/wtMnhJdCaR. Eleven-year-old Isaac Johnston asked me what else kids should be doing in addition to washing their hands and staying home. My advice was simple:

- Stay a safe distance from friends
- Sneeze into your elbow
- And eat your vegetables https://t.co/ksPS4Xb7Wm. A total of about 17 million people have filed for unemployment over the last three weeks. This is unprecedented. 

The economic devastation that families all across this country are experiencing is not their fault. We've got to take extraordinary steps to protect them. https://t.co/2EfSIYXkLt. We're seeing the soul of our nation on full display every day in this crisis <U+0097> and it makes me so proud to be an American. https://t.co/PERwpmeL2X. If we come together, we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation <U+0097> we will transform it.. Join our virtual town hall on unemployment and the issues currently facing working families across the nation. Tune in now: https://t.co/hHG9sgNoka. The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but the slow and chaotic response to it is. He's the commander in chief <U+0097> it's time he steps up, takes responsibility, and does his job. https://t.co/UFM5lPyzU3. The primary is over, but we're just getting started. We're building a campaign to defeat Donald Trump and ensure that America finally lives up to our founding promises <U+0097> but we can't do it without your help.

If you're with us, chip in today: https://t.co/bEBrI6DSqs. In the wake of COVID-19, working families across the country are facing a whole new set of challenges. This afternoon, I'll be hosting a town hall to listen to folks' concerns and discuss what we should be doing to deliver relief.

Tune in at 5:30 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/Xzgoj0E4vB. Together we will defeat Donald Trump. But we will also address the climate crisis. We will make college affordable. And we will make health care available to all.  We will not just rebuild this nation <U+0096> we<U+0092>ll transform it. And I<U+0092>m asking you to join me. https://t.co/vJXlroCdDd. And to Bernie<U+0092>s supporters: I know that I need to earn your votes. And I know that might take time. But I want you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of this moment. I hope you'll join us. You're more than welcome: You're needed.. We know how hard this is. You have put the interest of the nation <U+0096> and the need to defeat Donald Trump <U+0096> above all else. And for that we<U+0092>re grateful. But we want you to know: we<U+0092>ll be reaching out. You<U+0092>ll be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us.. To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven<U+0092>t just run a political campaign; you<U+0092>ve created a movement. And make no mistake about it, we believe it<U+0092>s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That<U+0092>s a good thing for our nation and our future.. I know Bernie well. He<U+0092>s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it<U+0092>s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won<U+0092>t try to. https://t.co/Z6OkCDWFNm. As Jewish families across America and around the world prepare to observe the first night of Passover, Jill and I want to say chag sameach, and offer our very best wishes, to all who are celebrating. https://t.co/Qg5Wa9ftyT. It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need. Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act to deliver these life-saving supplies. https://t.co/VrjN3fAkHi. We<U+0092>re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution<U+0097>which disproportionately affects communities of color &amp; low-income communities<U+0097>is linked to COVID-19 death rates. It's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is. https://t.co/3GD15s3xSy. The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we<U+0092>ve ever experienced as a nation. We need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. Because out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger <U+0097> and we will again.. Folks, I know these are tough times, but this crisis has made it clearer than ever how much elections matter <U+0097> and what a difference it makes who is in the White House. If you can, please chip in to fuel our campaign. I would really appreciate it. 
https://t.co/mZbSSmDbN2. @blackenterprise Jill and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Graves family. As the founder of Black Enterprise, Earl Graves Sr. was a trailblazer in his own right, a leader in the American business community, and paved the way for many Black entrepreneurs to realize their dreams.. On #WorldHealthDay, we thank the tireless health care workers fighting COVID-19, and we see clearly why protecting the health of Americans requires U.S. global leadership<U+0097>to coordinate an international response, strengthen health systems everywhere, and prevent the next pandemic.. Secretary Modly's resignation is appropriate and called for. His disparaging remarks were far beneath the dignity of the office he held. Our sailors, our nation, and Captain Crozier deserve better. https://t.co/cYW1qGhqqH. What do Fig Newtons and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches have in common? Listen to this preview of this week's podcast to find out <U+0097> and then check out the full episode at https://t.co/t11Fa0CorE or wherever you get your podcasts. https://t.co/AfL018UA4h. Congressman John Lewis is a moral giant who has spent his entire life pushing our nation to live up to our highest ideals. I'm honored to call him a friend <U+0097> and grateful to have him by my side in this battle for the soul of our nation. https://t.co/kqwe6CGre1. For months, I called on President Trump to step up and take the action necessary to combat COVID-19.

But week after week, he downplayed the threat it posed, misled the American people, and failed to act.

Take a look: https://t.co/IkkkdeRS8V. Judy, from itsJudysLife, asked an important question during our Family Town Hall on COVID-19: What extra precautions should expectant mothers be taking at this time?

Listen to what former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy had to say: https://t.co/Z1el7lgoyJ. Mr. President, I hope we can gather in Milwaukee, but that is going to depend on you stepping up and doing what needs to be done to handle this pandemic. I have laid out how you can do that: https://t.co/YLHCGEKnUB. Happy to discuss anytime. https://t.co/ePQuQKkeZV. Folks, our second episode of Here<U+0092>s the Deal is live! This week, @GovWhitmer joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, President Trump<U+0092>s personal attacks, and the importance of bipartisanship to deliver results.

Listen at https://t.co/t11Fa0CorE or wherever you get your podcasts.. It is close to criminal the way they<U+0092>re dealing with Captain Crozier. He spoke up to protect his sailors <U+0097> he should have a commendation, not be fired. https://t.co/ZnadEsljxX. During our Family Town Hall on COVID-19, I was asked what we can do to prevent this from happening again. Here<U+0092>s where I'd start: https://t.co/A4M8u9W2SR. During these uncertain times, getting the right information out there is so important.

Myself and @DrBiden had the opportunity to host a conversation about COVID-19 with 3 family vloggers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in now: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq. Every day that Donald Trump refuses to use the full power of the Defense Production Act further threatens American lives.. We all want to protect our families <U+0097> the first step is arming ourselves with the facts.
 
@DrBiden and I hosted a town hall on COVID-19 with three family YouTubers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in tonight at 7PM EDT: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/gIEPo2PjuO. We are at war with this virus <U+0097> and the health care workers on the front lines are our soldiers. It is unacceptable that they don<U+0092>t have the lifesaving masks, gowns, and protective gear they need. https://t.co/10Z6G7Rb2h. Out of every crisis, America has always emerged stronger <U+0097> and we will again. We will not be defeated. https://t.co/HLR9WBZBhR. Donald Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately. This is no time to put pettiness and ideology above helping those who are in the greatest need.

Lives are at stake. https://t.co/QbyOXboFbr. Jill and I had the pleasure of hosting a town hall with family vloggers ItsJudysLife, The Curly Coopers, and JHouse Vlogs where we answered their questions about the COVID-19 outbreak.

Tune in to the premiere on Sunday at 7PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/9fqyYsGwMJ. Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it.. We owe so much to those working around the clock to keep our country running during this crisis. The least we can do is provide the pay, benefits, and protections they need and deserve. https://t.co/XCTKfHv9wN. We need a Supply Commander to step up and take charge and get the doctors, nurses, health care workers, first responders, firefighters, and cops the equipment they need to protect themselves and save lives. https://t.co/3OgY1cRGlK. In January, while Donald Trump was downplaying COVID-19, I wrote an op-ed calling for immediate action to combat the growing threat.

In it, I also said Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis.

I stand by that statement. https://t.co/PH4vF5taDa. Throughout the campaign, I<U+0092>ve talked a lot about the soul of our nation <U+0097> we<U+0092>re seeing that soul on full display. There<U+0092>s so much good happening <U+0097> people reaching out to one another, neighbors helping neighbors, caring for those in need. It makes me so proud to be an American. https://t.co/aVOCC4vBWb. My friend, @GabbyGiffords, knows what it takes to persevere in the face of uncertainty. Take a few minutes to read these powerful words from her on how we can get through this <U+0097> together. https://t.co/Kl0OrjB3UG. This is a headline every American should see: <U+0093>Trump administration ended pandemic early-warning program to detect coronaviruses<U+0094>

Donald Trump<U+0092>s shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared to deal with this outbreak. https://t.co/P9zT0a3mNg. Those are the kinds of questions Trump will be responsible for. He doesn<U+0092>t have a great record when it comes to delivering on promises, but I hope this time is different.
 
Being president is about taking responsibility. The blame game won<U+0092>t cut it. Too many lives are at stake.. The CARES Act provides money to help working people<U+0097>how do we make sure it gets to them as quickly as possible?
 
There<U+0092>s money for major corporations<U+0097>how do we make sure that there is rigorous oversight to ensure it is used to help workers and not enrich top executives?. I<U+0092>ve done this work before. It<U+0092>s hard, painstaking work.
 
I was in charge of administering the $800 billion Recovery Act <U+0097> so I understand that the devil is in the details. It<U+0092>s about follow-through.. I<U+0092>ve put together a checklist for making the economic relief and recovery effort work for families, workers, and small businesses. I encourage President Trump to adopt any and all of the ideas. https://t.co/P5gq7h2rtE. Families across the country are impacted by COVID-19<U+0097>and it can be especially difficult to explain to children. 

Jill and I spoke with ItsJudysLife, JHouseVlogs and The Curly Coopers to answer their questions about the crisis. Tune in on Sunday at 7PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq https://t.co/TUQnhOroTU. Captain Crozier was faithful to his duty<U+0097>both to his sailors and his country. Navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. The poor judgment here belongs to the Trump Admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors. https://t.co/AkGFdlYjwt. This is another clear warning sign that more needs to be done to keep as many people on payroll as possible. Fast, bold action to bolster American workers now will save more pain later. Congress must get to work immediately on the next package. We can't afford to waste time. https://t.co/MGOztrldFE. Now more than ever, we need to choose hope over fear. We will beat COVID-19. We will overcome this. Together.. Wisconsin <U+0097> you have until 5 PM CT tonight to request your mail-in absentee ballot ahead of next week<U+0092>s primary. Head to https://t.co/hkOfDswg34 to request yours today. https://t.co/6Ldcy3QBT6. The evidence is clear: Donald Trump ignored the warnings. He failed to act. And now Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/1qROBGtsSs. Real courage is confronting something that you're afraid to do and doing it anyway. That<U+0092>s what people across this country are doing every single day in the face of this crisis. They are American heroes. https://t.co/KQQiU9P8xz. In order for our government to work for all Americans, it's important it be representative of all Americans. With openly LGBTQ individuals only making up .17% of elected officials, we have work to do.

This National #OutToWin Day, I'm asking: Will you run? https://t.co/QvM6IINN4T. I'm about to roll out my plan to make the economic recovery work. Tune in now: https://t.co/fLTDvwK1wf. My heart goes out to the millions of Americans who filed unemployment claims in recent weeks, and the millions more who worry what next week holds for them.

Donald Trump needs to take action to ensure Americans receive the economic relief they need as soon as possible. https://t.co/SprkkQzbTo. I know many folks are feeling anxious and worried. I just want you to know that you're not alone. Americans in every corner of the country are feeling the same exact way you are. We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together <U+0097> and we will overcome this. I promise.. Our health care workers on the front lines of this fight still don<U+0092>t have the masks, gowns, and other protective equipment they need. It<U+0092>s unacceptable.

Add your name to demand Donald Trump use his full authority to deliver these lifesaving supplies: https://t.co/bnHqHEIp1T. The economic damage from this public health crisis is both rising and deepening at an alarming rate. It is putting working families and the American middle class through unimaginable financial pain <U+0097> and they need to be made whole as fast as possible. https://t.co/QNuB29JcGy. It's now April, and:

- States still don't have enough tests
- Hospitals still don't have enough ventilators
- Health care workers still don't have enough masks

Donald Trump needs to use all available authorities immediately to solve these shortages.. At a time when Americans might need health care the most, the Trump Administration is preventing people who need insurance from getting it. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds. https://t.co/PelIrNxBNQ. Amigos, <U+00A1>es el D<ed>a del Censo! Solo toma unos minutos completar el Censo, pero ayudar<e1> a determinar el futuro de su comunidad para la pr<f3>xima d<e9>cada. Visite https://t.co/fcbpzx0tJp para que lo cuenten hoy.. Folks, it<U+0092>s Census Day! The Census only takes a few minutes to complete but will help determine the future of your community for the next decade. Head to https://t.co/fcbpzx0tJp to get counted today.. It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need.. Thank you to the governors who are meeting this moment with decisive action, a steady hand, and compassionate leadership. Thank you for stepping up when President Trump has not.. We<U+0092>re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is preventing people from getting health care.

I can<U+0092>t believe this needs to be said, but President Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment, and he needs to do it now. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/84LANkB4AL. Hoy, al honrar la vida y el legado del activista C<e9>sar Ch<e1>vez, tambi<e9>n agradecemos a los m<e1>s de 2 millones de trabajadores agr<ed>colas que est<e1>n en primera l<ed>nea, trabajando para mantener a los estadounidenses alimentados y sanos durante esta pandemia. https://t.co/MNl59g81OV. Today as we honor the life and legacy of civil rights and labor movement activist, C<e9>sar Ch<e1>vez, we also thank the more than 2 million farmworkers who are on the frontlines, working to keep Americans fed and healthy during this pandemic. https://t.co/MNl59g81OV. Tonight marks our biggest public end-of-quarter deadline of the campaign so far. I know times are tough, but what<U+0092>s at stake in this election has never been clearer. If you could chip in to help us reach our goal, I would really appreciate it: https://t.co/qRzUR2DdVI. It's 2020 <U+0097> it<U+0092>s unacceptable that women still don<U+0092>t get equal pay for equal work. Let<U+0092>s close the gender pay gap and end #EqualPayDay once and for all. https://t.co/GH6rASk0wH. In the midst of a pandemic, the Trump Administration chose to expend effort to attempt to disestablish the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe<U+0092>s reservation. #IStandwithMashpee and with all of Indian Country. https://t.co/5Z6nZjClAf. Today and every day, @DrBiden and I are proud to stand with the trans community. We see you, we support you, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure you are affirmed and accepted just as you are. #TransDayOfVisibility. As president, I would never send an American soldier anywhere in the world without the equipment and protection they need. We should not do any less for the heroes on the front lines of the battle we<U+0092>re in now. https://t.co/ZWNExlKq3H. I'm confident that the American people will meet this moment. There<U+0092>s never been a challenge we've been unable to overcome if we do it together.. We have to place a temporary ban on evictions nationwide. No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic.. In order to combat COVID-19, we need both a decisive public health response and a decisive economic response. I<U+0092>ve laid out exactly what I would do if I were president during this crisis, take a look: https://t.co/Q58OQW6tQO. Our health care workers are putting their lives on the line every day, and our president is accusing them of stealing lifesaving supplies. It's time for Donald Trump to do his job, so our heroes are able to do theirs. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/qiwRjrVUYz. This is unconscionable. Americans are already afraid of the impact the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is having on their lives <U+0097> they don't need the added stress of losing their health insurance. Drop the lawsuit. https://t.co/VyN90rluy9. I know these are confusing and scary times, so for the first episode of our new podcast I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, to help provide some clarity around COVID-19.

Listen at https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo or wherever you get your podcasts. https://t.co/bCd1houIqo. The medical professionals on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes <U+0097> risking their lives in order to save others. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. #NationalDoctorsDay. President Trump should be using the Defense Production Act to get our first responders and health care providers the masks, gowns, and protective equipment they need. This is a matter of life and death. https://t.co/i4jNeL7yoc. The American people are generous, decent, good, and fair. In times of crisis, we come together as one. We look out for our neighbors and lend a hand to those in need. We will get through this, together. I promise.. Not a joke, folks, we just launched our new podcast. It<U+0092>s called ""Here's the Deal."" For our first episode, I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, for a discussion on COVID-19.

Listen at https://t.co/t11Fa0TZjc or wherever you get your podcasts.. I am issuing this challenge to the President: in the next 48 hours, direct the production and distribution of respirator masks, gloves, protective face shields and gowns to fill every supply request made by a governor to the federal government. 

Lives are at stake.. As president, I will always choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.. It's hard to read this story and not conclude one thing: The Trump Administration failed the American people. https://t.co/I3LOMEvLMf. Instacart needs to step up and give their workers the protections and pay they need and deserve. Now. https://t.co/dYkoW0H227. Dreamers are Americans. We should never endanger or throw into question their ability to contribute to our nation, but to do so in a moment of national crisis is beyond misguided. https://t.co/6n7kQbw6QH. The folks working to keep our country running are true heroes <U+0097> and we need to ensure they have the protections, accommodations, and benefits they need and deserve. We couldn't get through this without them. https://t.co/eErp14BkuK. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, but it<U+0092>s even harder when you<U+0092>re not able to be with them in their final moments <U+0097> and that<U+0092>s what<U+0092>s happening around the country because of the coronavirus. It<U+0092>s heartbreaking, and I<U+0092>m keeping everyone affected in my prayers. https://t.co/vAISTRxi5O. The Administration promised millions of tests by mid-March. But it's not happening fast enough. Where are the tests, Mr. President? https://t.co/pI8WBL7oE7. Mr. President, this isn<U+0092>t about you, it<U+0092>s about the health of the American people. Stop making everything personal.

You are the president of all 50 states <U+0097> not just the ones that voted for you or that have governors who <U+0093>treat you right.<U+0094> It<U+0092>s time you acted like it. https://t.co/iMoBKklscY. Last night, the great Rev. Joseph E. Lowery passed away, leaving an indelible mark on our country's history towards progress. He never once wavered in his spirit and in the resolve to end injustice <U+0097> wherever he saw it. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. https://t.co/FPEAyxwTxm. I just wrapped up tonight<U+0092>s CNN town hall, where we discussed COVID-19 and how we move forward. I know times are tough, but the stakes in this election have never been higher. If you could chip in a few dollars I would really appreciate it. https://t.co/1PoT5yD9CO. You can't deal with the economic crisis until you deal with the public health crisis. It's a false choice. https://t.co/8y1UMD4fMT. In response to the economic impact of COVID-19, we need to provide immediate relief to those who are drowning in student debt. https://t.co/kyZstGHHCG. Join me and the hardworking folks on the frontlines of the COVID-19 outbreak for a virtual round table. Tune in now: https://t.co/SKRTT621IO. This afternoon, I<U+0092>ll be sitting down for a conversation with nurses, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. Tune in at 4:15 ET to join us: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50. Patients need ventilators.

Nurses need equipment.

And Donald Trump is attacking people who dare to do something about it. 

I thank God every day for people like @GovWhitmer, who are doing the work he won<U+0092>t. https://t.co/vGruGrMVL8. The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is.

He ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.. It<U+0092>s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it<U+0092>s just a matter of when <U+0097> and it<U+0092>s the president<U+0092>s job to ensure we<U+0092>re ready.

Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/45GVHtxUHA. The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:

- Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person
- Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it
- Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine. The American people are incredible. Across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. I'm so darn proud to be an American. https://t.co/bCyYCFBAML. President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don<U+0092>t have jobs because he didn<U+0092>t do his job when it mattered. https://t.co/xlLlQCHn3c. Thank you to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, and everyone on the front lines of this fight. Your hard work is what makes America run every single day <U+0097> but especially in times of crisis. We truly couldn't get through this without you. https://t.co/kr8Q6Me77H. We've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on Main Street.

It's simple: The government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast.

If they won't, we need a financial version of the Defense Production Act to make it happen. https://t.co/k4ePem9xLX. If I were President, here's what I would do right now:

- Use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic
- Launch a task force to ensure money rapidly gets to people who need it
- Bring leaders of Congress together to build the next deal https://t.co/F14kf8MRUF. It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice. I will do the opposite of what we<U+0092>re seeing Donald Trump do every day.. Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things <U+0097> folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. Stories like this one make me so proud to be an American. We will overcome this challenge <U+0097> together. https://t.co/hazgIbUHe4. The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work: https://t.co/RmcOh0rRPL. ""If the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in February, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late April. Now it is unlikely to be before June.""

Donald Trump's inaction will cost lives. https://t.co/83kiIngP6o. In times of crisis, American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. But all we've gotten from Donald Trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats.

Trump has failed our country at a time when we need him most. https://t.co/d2vxUHGiH0. Alright @TeamJoe, join us for Happy Hour. Watch our virtual round table on the issues that matter to young folks: https://t.co/pFhYghw5dt. We will not allow this pandemic to rob our young people of the futures and the economic opportunities they have been working to build. https://t.co/IMsaB6Eeba. Alright, folks. We're doing a happy hour tonight and you're invited. Join us at 6:30 PM ET at https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq. https://t.co/2Y8lpI2bEj. I'm about to deliver remarks on the impact of the Coronavirus on Young Americans. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/hOoL3U77Ni. The character of the American people is on full display across the country. In the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. The Angeleno Campaign, led by my friend Mayor @EricGarcetti, is a great example of the work being done. https://t.co/eo8GGH6hmG. Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.

No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.. President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that<U+0092>s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we<U+0092>re paying the price. https://t.co/HCNDWim5Oc. As Americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. When we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. And we are not going to be defeated now. https://t.co/T3pFw3DQlj. President Trump should stop attacking our nation's governors on Twitter and start delivering them the life-saving supplies they need. https://t.co/0Xa4Ewbozu. Let me be clear: Donald Trump knew about the threat the coronavirus posed and failed to act. It<U+0092>s one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history. https://t.co/l8BdATZsaL. The stakes in this election couldn<U+0092>t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation <U+0097> and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.. I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this <U+0097> together.. As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk <U+0097> Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.

No more games. Drop this lawsuit. Save lives. https://t.co/aSgzVzOvlV. In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was <U+0093>totally under control.<U+0094>

In February, he said it would disappear.

Now, he<U+0092>s saying it <U+0093>could<U+0092>ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.<U+0094>

Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we<U+0092>re paying the price.. Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans. Brave and big-hearted. Always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need.

We will overcome this, together. https://t.co/qeNUK1y5fx. Where are the tests?
Where are the masks?
Where are the ventilators?

The American people deserve answers, Mr. President. https://t.co/N2MWYKOzOu. Obamacare was a big deal <U+0097> and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need. https://t.co/aXqHL7LN9f. A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. We have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers <U+0097> not their CEOs.

It's time for President Trump and Mitch McConnell to put American families first. https://t.co/SWU2bLhCGj. During a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that Donald Trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. This morning, I called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect Americans' health care. https://t.co/PlfeFNwhG2. What is President Trump waiting for? 

Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.

Hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick Americans could literally need to breathe.

He needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/du94NRJ0YI. I'm about to deliver remarks on the Coronavirus pandemic. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/HpaqlEb7D1. President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. It's simply wrong. We need to be focused on helping hardworking Americans, communities, and small businesses <U+0097> not handing big corporations a blank check. https://t.co/tMBZm26h3y. It<U+0092>s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it<U+0092>s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first <U+0097> not the big corporations looking for a blank check. https://t.co/pxGrnTYebF. President Trump<U+0092>s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history. 
https://t.co/pFIoZCJWmH. In this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. It's not just good economics <U+0097> it's the right thing to do. We have to get this right.. We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now.. Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again.. On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: <U+0093>Anybody that wants a test can get a test.<U+0094>

That was a flat-out lie then, and it<U+0092>s still not true today. It<U+0092>s a disgrace.

We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period.. No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs.. No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks.. It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. https://t.co/mFsPjmlbHW. We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you<U+0092>re doing.. Mr. President <U+0097> stop lying and start acting. Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go. https://t.co/uIi1Rxha1C. In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people.

Donald Trump is incapable of doing that. https://t.co/0I7ZYNtqCV. We need action, not more empty words from President Trump. It<U+0092>s time for him to step up and do his job. https://t.co/TBpXhoAg1P. Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us: https://t.co/XRkIw2EzM4. The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.

The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.

Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.

We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs.. From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country <U+0097> and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise.. The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He<U+0092>s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.. Now he<U+0092>s switched to falsely telling us that he<U+0092>s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he<U+0092>s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns.. In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China<U+0092>s response for managing the coronavirus.. If you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. They represent who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We look out for each other. And that<U+0092>s how we<U+0092>ll get through this <U+0097> together. https://t.co/rardKq7Dtd. The President says no one cares about being tested.

Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested? https://t.co/WrFcgCtriA. Getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but Senate Republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. That<U+0092>s terrible economics &amp; terrible values. We should be targeting help to those who need it most. https://t.co/J0tS9K7c9Y. The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections.. Every CEO in America should be focusing on workers, families, and communities <U+0097> not executive compensation and share prices.. I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees.. .@SenGillibrand has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. I'm thrilled and honored to have her support. https://t.co/3DWCZnsnqB. The words of a president matter, and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19 and mislead the American people. He is unfit to lead us through this crisis. https://t.co/s7tnaR4G7p. Every worker on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. I'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks <U+0097> employers must do the same. https://t.co/QClURuStbV. Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?. Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words.. .@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I<U+0092>m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.. This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another.

When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we<U+0092>ll lift this nation up and get through this together.. The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19.

Donald Trump eliminated it <U+0097> and now we're paying the price.. I give you my word as a Biden: When I'm president, I will lead with science, listen to the experts and heed their advice, and always tell you the truth. https://t.co/tIpjW1ch0L. We need comprehensive action to combat the coronavirus outbreak. That's why I'm calling for a decisive public health response to curb its spread and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief. https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3. I know the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. There<U+0092>s nothing we<U+0092>ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.. Much has been made of changes in President Trump's tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink <U+0097> and so many lives at stake <U+0097> it<U+0092>s time to be less interested in his words and more focused on his actions <U+0097> or inaction. https://t.co/txoIVUWxTO. In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. That's who we are.

We can and will meet this challenge <U+0097> together. https://t.co/xGcTQuc2gB. The next president will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize our country and our allies to rapidly meet new challenges <U+0097> like future pandemics.

We need a leader who will be ready on day one. https://t.co/oizwBqv4Wd. Thank you to everyone in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois who supported our campaign. From day one, our goal has been to unify our party and our nation <U+0097> and tonight, we are one step closer to achieving that goal. Let<U+0092>s do this, together. https://t.co/tcLufz2SBV. I'm about to address tonight's election results from Delaware. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/zNUoV08KVa. This moment demands that we choose:

Hope over fear
Unity over division
Truth over lies
Science over fiction. This crisis requires a decisive economic response. We need to do whatever it takes to deliver relief for our families and ensure the stability of our economy.. Elections are happening today in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can. If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don<U+0092>t touch your face, and stay 6<U+0092> from others in line. Learn more: https://t.co/yzZZp4uKFk. My mom always said, ""Being Irish is about faith, family, and courage.""

Today, we celebrate the strong role Irish-Americans have played in our communities, the strength of the U.S.-Ireland relationship, and the ongoing values shared by our two nations. Happy St. Patrick's Day! https://t.co/iUwvpb4Zk8. Michigan<U+0092>s response has far outpaced the federal government<U+0092>s in this crisis. Gov. Whitmer is leading decisively, while you are live-tweeting her appearances on cable news.

We need a president who will do their job and lead this country. https://t.co/WaZhxOdy6x. Coronavirus is bigger than any one of us. Please take care of yourself, wash your hands, and practice social distancing. We will get through this <U+0097> together. https://t.co/133eiugfnJ. If I win the nomination, my pick for vice president will be a woman. If I win the presidency and have the opportunity, I will name the first black woman ever to the Supreme Court.

A Biden administration will reflect the country we are proud to work for. https://t.co/1rFvE94YIg. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump threatens everything we stand for, he has:

- Fanned the flames of hate
- Embraced white supremacists
- Separated families at the border
- Threatened our democracy

We have to get him out of the White House.. The coronavirus pandemic is bigger than any one individual. This moment requires all of us to come together <U+0097> across the country and around the world <U+0097> to solve this crisis. https://t.co/cbPrIYyjsa. In the wake of the coronavirus, we need a major bailout package that delivers real relief to the American people <U+0097> not more handouts for giant corporations. https://t.co/Fi8SwNXDU5. Thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. This coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits.. I know times are tough <U+0097> but we<U+0092>re going to get through this. 

We<U+0092>ve got four big primaries coming up on Tuesday, and our campaign could really use your help. Chip in what you can <U+0097> I really appreciate it: https://t.co/CoE18Qvo1b https://t.co/lfA6xEp9MI. $90 billion in clean energy funding. A huge reduction in the cost of solar so that we'll never build another coal plant again. 



I did that. Bernie watched. #DemDebate. We're building the campaign that will win this nomination and defeat Donald Trump. If you're with us, please chip in what you can right now to keep the momentum going from tonight's #DemDebate: https://t.co/K7gZczYZlN. The coronavirus pandemic is like a war. And in a war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people. #DemDebate https://t.co/3U1aarm3Ho. We need a comprehensive response to the coronavirus outbreak. My plan mounts a decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief.

https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD https://t.co/WQgl2SyM4z. We have to treat climate change like the existential threat it is. As president, I will:

- End subsidies for fossil fuel corporations
- Ban new drilling on federal lands &amp; waters
- Hold oil executives accountable
- Rally the world to raise the commitments of the Paris Agreement. No se puede negar la amenaza existencial del cambio clim<e1>tico, y se est<e1> acabando el tiempo para abordarlo. Tenemos que tomar medidas sin precedentes aqu<ed> en nuestro pa<ed>s y unir al mundo para hacer frente a esta crisis. 

Lea el plan completo: https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo. There is no denying the existential threat of climate change <U+0097> and time is running out to address it. We have to take unprecedented action here at home and rally the world to tackle this crisis head on.
 
Read the full plan: https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo. Bernie Sanders voted against comprehensive immigration reform <U+0097> and then went on TV with Lou Dobbs to brag about it.

Immigrants don't take our jobs. They create jobs. And we need a President who believes that to his or her core. #DemDebate https://t.co/lHePLtlTpo. If Senator @BernieSanders is the nominee, I will throw my full weight behind his campaign and do everything I can to get him elected. If I am the nominee, I hope he will do the same. Nothing can keep us from being united in the fight to defeat Trump. #DemDebate. Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times. 

We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA <U+0097> not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures.. People need help now. Not four years from now. Not eight years from now. We need a health care plan that can pass. #DemDebate. Senator @BernieSanders' attacks on my record on Social Security are a bunch of malarkey <U+0097> and @PolitiFact agrees.

We should be focused on going after Donald Trump <U+0097> not fellow Democrats. #DemDebate https://t.co/PEfKDyUBlW. All those people Bernie says he cares about would have been in deep trouble without the bailout in 2008/2009. It was about saving the economy <U+0097> and I agree with Bernie, some bank executives should have gone to jail. #DemDebate. This is a crisis. We<U+0092>re at war with a virus. 

No one should have to pay for coronavirus health care costs. #DemDebate. We need leadership that listens to science.
 
We need leaders who listen to experts and heed their advice.
 
We need American leadership that will rally the world to meet global threats.
 
We need leaders who are honest.
 
That is the responsibility of a president. https://t.co/zcdYiNWRCf. When we have a coronavirus vaccine ready to go, it should be made widely available, free of charge. Period.. This primary has brought out our party's best ideas, and our nation is better for it. If I'm President, I'll continue to bring the best ideas from all corners of the country and fight to make them reality. To see these plans, you can go to my website: https://t.co/8bAii5T2FF. Second: Few people in the country understand how bankruptcy hurts working families more than Elizabeth Warren. Today, I am fully endorsing and adopting her bankruptcy plan, which she called ""Fixing Our Bankruptcy System to Give People a Second Chance."". First: Bernie has put forward a plan that would make public colleges and universities free for families whose income is below $125,000. It's a good idea, and after consideration, I am proud to add it to my platform.. Across the country, middle and working class families are being squeezed by debt. This is a massive problem, and one that we need all of the best ideas to solve. That's why today, I'm adopting two plans from @BernieSanders and @ewarren to achieve this.. No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. https://t.co/FwxXvfTchd. I'm incredibly grateful for @SpeakerPelosi's leadership every day <U+0097> but especially in times of crisis. @senatemajldr McConnell should bring back the Senate immediately and pass this important bill to provide relief for American families. https://t.co/eylYXfvFNm. If you're exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 <U+0097> or might be at risk <U+0097> absentee or vote by mail options are the best way to make your voice heard, while protecting your neighbors.. The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is. State election officials are working closely with public health officials to hold safe elections. If you are feeling healthy, not showing symptoms, and not at risk of being exposed to COVID-19: please vote on Tuesday.. The coronavirus will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society.

We need to take action to combat it.

https://t.co/6TVMKr9ygx https://t.co/E7J9olEhIR. The American people have the capacity to meet this moment. We will come together, look out for one another, and harness the ingenuity of our scientists. We can and will meet this challenge<U+0097>together. https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD. This crisis requires a national response. Not just from our elected leaders, or public health officials<U+0097>but from all of us. We must follow the guidance of the @CDCgov and health officials and take appropriate precautions to protect ourselves and, critically, to protect others.. I know many are anxious about the spread of the coronavirus and the threat it poses. And my thoughts are with all those affected, our first responders and health care providers who are putting themselves on the line for others, and everyone making sacrifices to stop the spread.. The White House is no place for on-the-job training <U+0097> Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus has made that even more clear. We need a president who is ready to clean up his mess, take responsibility, and lead us forward on day one.. We<U+0092>re building a campaign powered by the backbone and the base of the Democratic party. A campaign that will defeat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation. Join us: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW. I believe this nation can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if he<U+0092>s given eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.

We can<U+0092>t let that happen. We have to defeat Donald Trump.. At a moment when there is so much fear around the world, we need honest, steady, trusted American leadership.

If I<U+0092>m elected president, I promise you I'll strive to give the nation that very leadership every day. https://t.co/WjOHDVMb6X. A wall will not stop the coronavirus.

Banning all travel from Europe <U+0097> or any other part of the world <U+0097> will not stop it.

This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet <U+0097> and we need a plan to combat it.. .@CoryBooker is right <U+0097> this is our moment in history. We need your help to beat Donald Trump and set our nation on a new path. If you<U+0092>re with us, chip in today: https://t.co/SxalF8DnNU https://t.co/kfq0AMwyZm. No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks, but I can promise you this: When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better, and recover better. We'll lead with science and listen to the experts. And I will always, always tell you the truth.. We need to ensure that every person who needs a coronavirus test can get one <U+0097> and that the test is free. Period.. Today, I'm releasing my plan to combat the coronavirus. We need:

- A decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need
- A decisive economic response that delivers real relief https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD. I'm about to address the nation on how we should confront the corona virus pandemic. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/OdaeTNw40B. To all those who have been knocked down, counted out, or left behind <U+0097> this is your campaign. We need you and we want you in this fight.

Join us: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW https://t.co/ACpw1DseBe. At this moment <U+0097> when there is so much fear in the country and all across the world <U+0097> we need American leadership. We need presidential leadership.

Today at 1:00 PM EST, I<U+0092>ll be addressing the nation on how we should be moving forward to confront the #CoronavirusPandemic.. Together, we're creating a movement that will defeat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation. https://t.co/vAylAFIwFn. Donald Trump's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy is dangerous, inhumane, and goes against everything we stand for as a nation of immigrants. My administration will end it. https://t.co/toYzMaPP1Y. After last night, we are one step closer to restoring decency, dignity, and honor to the White House.. I wish Donald Trump would just be quiet and let the experts do the talking when it comes to the coronavirus. https://t.co/x47PGPls2Y. .@AndrewYang is one of the brightest minds there is when it comes to the challenges we face in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I'm honored to have his endorsement <U+0097> and look forward to working with him to ensure every worker can succeed in the changing 21st-century economy.. Today is a historic day for the #MeToo movement &amp; for survivors of sexual violence. The bravery of those who stopped Weinstein cannot be overstated, &amp; the burden of speaking out cannot be on survivors alone. We have to change our culture &amp; our system to end sexual assault. https://t.co/LIhnOv8bFg. If you're a member of the #KHive, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. I would be honored to have your support. https://t.co/3GqvPi1E0y. Once we get Donald Trump out of the White House, we have an enormous opportunity to build the future this nation deserves. A future where every American has access to affordable health care, where we end our gun violence epidemic, and where we tackle the climate crisis head-on.. It's been a great night <U+0097> thank you for all of your support! We<U+0092>re bringing this party together and it's going to take all of us to keep it going. Chip in now to take us across the finish line and defeat Donald Trump: https://t.co/wn91EhVZ5V https://t.co/vncQYgE6Eg.

In 1994, I took on the @NRA to pass a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The ban saved lives <U+0097> and Republicans should have never let it expire.

As president, I<U+0092>ll ban them once again. We will get these weapons of war out of our communities. https://t.co/4ciJQTNxvR. I<U+0092>m a union guy and always have been. I stand with @UFCW <U+0097> and as president, I<U+0092>ll invest in American workers.

Let<U+0092>s be clear: Russia is engaging in interference in this election right now, as we speak. #DemDebate. My first effort as a county council member was doing away with redlining <U+0097> and I didn<U+0092>t stop there. I've fought against housing discrimination my entire career. #DemDebate. Tom Steyer invested $90 million in the nation's largest private prison company <U+0097> a company that allegedly hog-tied and beat kids in South Carolina. It's despicable.

President Obama and I worked to phase out private prisons <U+0097> I will fight to get rid of them as president. https://t.co/6KOxewPF2B. I<U+0092>ve worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African American community.

Enact universal background checks.

Hold gun manufacturers accountable.

End our gun violence epidemic.. In 2005, I voted to allow Americans to hold gun manufacturers accountable for the death and terror they've caused in our country. 

Bernie Sanders voted to let them off the hook. https://t.co/nVMAn5xpbx. This moment requires strong American leadership and disciplined diplomacy to lead a global response grounded in science <U+0097> Donald Trump is incapable of that. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency. https://t.co/U72s7aVQtd. The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We should be making voting easier <U+0097> not harder.. This election is about more than just beating Donald Trump. It<U+0092>s about:

- Replacing Betsy DeVos with an actual educator
- Having an Attorney General who defends the Constitution, not the president
- Ensuring our EPA Administrator believes climate change is an existential threat. Our comeback started in Nevada. Now, we need your help to carry this momentum to South Carolina, Super Tuesday, and beyond.

But far too many Americans lack access to affordable, quality, and safe housing. 

Today, I'm releasing my $640 billion plan to change that: https://t.co/u2xzmvjDaW. Donald Trump is the most corrupt president we<U+0092>ve ever had <U+0097> and the American people deserve to know what he<U+0092>s hiding in his tax returns.. We<U+0092>re not just trying to beat Donald Trump. We<U+0092>ve got to take back the Senate, keep the House of Representatives, and unite our party. https://t.co/mPfsp2hh7n. Over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions live in fear that their health care will be taken away from them.

The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 was our best shot at fixing our broken immigration system. It had bipartisan support and would have put millions of immigrants on the pathway to citizenship.

Bernie Sanders voted against it. https://t.co/7eU37Jq2RC. Donald Trump and Stephen Miller have raised the standard of cruelty with their inhumane immigration policies. We have to get them out of the White House and ensure our laws reflect our values as a nation of immigrants.. Tomorrow is Caucus Day in Nevada, and we need your help to bring us across the finish line.

Alex, a law enforcement officer and former Marine from Reno, supports common-sense gun safety reform <U+0097> just like the majority of America. Here<U+0092>s why he<U+0092>s supporting our campaign: https://t.co/BAM6qFjHzs. I'm about to take the stage for tonight's town hall in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tune in to @CNN at 8 PM ET to watch live.. Let me be clear: Mayor Bloomberg should release folks from their non-disclosure agreements. This is about transparency. The American people deserve to know the truth. https://t.co/IdRmpGpumm. We have to take on the @NRA and pass real reform to end our gun violence epidemic. That starts with universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and holding gun manufacturers accountable.

I've beaten the gun lobby twice <U+0097> and I'll do it again as president.. We fall into the same pattern every time: a senseless act of violence occurs, politicians offer <U+0093>thoughts and prayers,<U+0094> and calls for reform fade away until the next tragedy inevitably occurs.

I<U+0092>m sick and tired of saying <U+0093>enough is enough.<U+0094> We can<U+0092>t go on like this any longer.. Last night<U+0092>s debate took place blocks away from the site of the deadliest mass shooting in American history <U+0097> where a lone gunman took 58 precious lives and injured hundreds of others. Yet there were zero questions about how we end our gun violence epidemic. It was unacceptable.. It<U+0092>s simple: If you like your private health insurance plan, you should be able to keep it. If you don<U+0092>t like it, you should be able to choose a new public option.

That<U+0092>s the choice my administration will give every American <U+0097> and we<U+0092>ll do it without raising middle class taxes. https://t.co/pQ8LjknasW. Trump thinks the media is the enemy of the people. He's dead wrong.

America<U+0092>s commitment to free press, free speech, and free expression should never waver, and certainly not in the face of Chinese authoritarianism. We've got to stand up for these freedoms at home and abroad. https://t.co/INm6CoQUci.

You can sue pharmaceutical companies.

The only companies you can<U+0092>t sue are gun manufacturers because of a law Bernie Sanders voted for. #DemDebate. I visited the Techren solar facility. Let me tell you: Nevada gets it. Solar facilities like this one are powering our transition to clean energy and creating jobs in the process. We've got to transition to a clean energy economy. #DemDebate https://t.co/Go3jYCqz1f. Obamacare was and is a big deal. The law:

- Covered 20 million additional Americans
- Protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions
- Allows young people to stay on their parents<U+0092> plans until age 26

Mike Bloomberg calls that <U+0093>a disgrace.<U+0094> I call it progress. #DemDebate https://t.co/2uFOJf2kBd. Lots of people on stage talked about health care tonight.

- 685,724 people were stopped
- Nearly 80% were black or latino
- Nearly 90% were innocent.

He defended it as recently as this year. Who does he think he<U+0092>s fooling? #DemDebate https://t.co/vKuRvwVjrw. NBC did a poll the other day. Who did it say the best person to beat Donald Trump was?

The White House is no place for on-the-job training. We need a president who will be ready on day one. https://t.co/IF17cwXud9. I've taken on the @NRA and beaten them <U+0097> twice. And I'll do it again as president because everyone should need to pass a background check to buy a gun. https://t.co/Ti2iuhC1Hx. I know that these past few years have felt like a constant crisis. But this moment is more than a crisis <U+0097> it<U+0092>s also an extraordinary opportunity. It<U+0092>s a chance for us to come back together as a nation to reassert the values that define us as Americans.. Let's be clear: Weapons of war have no place in our communities.

That's why I took on the @NRA and passed a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines <U+0097> and I'll do it again as president. https://t.co/hMQvuuXtNv.

On Veterans Day and every day, thank you to all who have defended our nation.. We just held an election, and our country made a clear choice: each vote for @JoeBiden was a statement that health care should be a right<U+0097>not a privilege. 

And we won that election decisively, with more votes than have ever been cast in American history.. If the Affordable Care Act is struck down, communities of color would be hit particularly hard. We are at a greater risk of preexisting conditions, and three times more likely to contract COVID-19.. Today, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act. Getting rid of the ACA will take us backward to a time when you could charge a woman more for her health care<U+0097>just because she<U+0092>s a woman.. All Americans deserve to have access to quality, affordable health care. Tune in now to hear Joe Biden<U+0092>s plan to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act in a Biden-Harris administration. https://t.co/I8b8ecZD5m. Yesterday, @JoeBiden and I met with our COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board, comprised of distinguished public health experts. This team will help translate the Biden-Harris COVID-19 plan into an action blueprint that we can put into place as soon as we are sworn in on January 20. https://t.co/2ZSIu0nmHx. I know times have been challenging, especially these last few months. The grief, sorrow, and pain. The worries and the struggles. But we<U+0092>ve also seen the incredible resilience of our neighbors, the courage of our frontline workers, and the generosity of the American people.. As @JoeBiden said yesterday, we are facing a dark winter if we don<U+0092>t get coronavirus under control. Please wear a mask to reduce the spread and save lives.. .@JoeBiden and I are ready to write the next chapter in our nation<U+0092>s history.

On day one, we're going to get to work building an economy that works for working families.. I want to speak directly to the Black women in our country. Thank you. You are too often overlooked, and yet are asked time and again to step up and be the backbone of our democracy. We could not have done this without you.. On day one, @JoeBiden and I are ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis. Tune now for remarks after our first COVID-19 Council briefing. https://t.co/2ynh7aDXjS. .@JoeBiden and I are ready to get COVID-19 under control. We<U+0092>re ready to rebuild our economy. We<U+0092>re ready to meet the challenges of the climate crisis. We<U+0092>re ready to act to address systemic racism. And we<U+0092>re ready to fight for you.. .@JoeBiden centered unity at the heart of our campaign. He pledged to fight to restore the soul of our nation and bring us together. That<U+0092>s the kind of leader he is<U+0097>and the kind of president he will be.. To the American people<U+0097>no matter who you voted for<U+0097>I will strive to be a Vice President like @JoeBiden was to President @BarackObama: loyal, honest, and prepared, waking up every day thinking of you and your families.. .@JoeBiden is a healer, a uniter, a tested, and steady hand. A person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us, as a nation, reclaim our own sense of purpose. https://t.co/kQN5TTuIPz. I<U+0092>m thinking about my mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, and the generations of Black women who came before me who believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible. https://t.co/c3f13juMPw. Now the real work begins.

To beat this pandemic. 
To rebuild our economy.
To root out systemic racism in our justice system and society.
To combat the climate crisis.
To heal the soul of our nation.

The road ahead won't be easy. But America is ready. And so are @JoeBiden and I.. While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last<U+0097>because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.. For four years, you marched and organized for equality and justice, for our lives, and for our planet. And then, you voted.

You voted for hope, unity, decency, science, and truth when you chose @JoeBiden as the next President of the United States of America.. To our campaign staff and volunteers, thank you for bringing more people than ever before into the democratic process. 

To all the poll workers and election officials, our nation owes you a debt of gratitude.

And to the American people: thank you for making your voices heard.. Congressman John Lewis wrote before his passing: <U+0093>Democracy is not a state. It is an act.<U+0094>

What he meant was that America<U+0092>s democracy is not guaranteed. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it<U+0097>and that<U+0092>s exactly what you did.. Thank you to the American people for the faith you have entrusted in us. Tune in now as President-elect @JoeBiden and I address the nation. https://t.co/KQvJiWIEdJ. This election is about so much more than @JoeBiden or me. It<U+0092>s about the soul of America and our willingness to fight for it. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Let<U+0092>s get started.
https://t.co/Bb9JZpggLN. Over 100 million Americans voted before Election Day with a belief in our electoral process<U+0097>trusting that their ballots would count.

Tune in now as our campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon and campaign adviser Bob Bauer give an update on the state of the race. https://t.co/IVnzqCftMM. Americans should have faith in the voting process and have the constitutional right to have their lawfully cast ballots counted. That simple proposition is a cornerstone of American democracy.. <U+0093>No one<U+0092>s going to take our democracy away from us, not now, not ever.<U+0094> <U+0097>@JoeBiden
https://t.co/1hFWxbQjfs. No matter what Trump says, we must count every single vote.

Honor their sacrifice by voting before polls close: https://t.co/VbrfuqVy9P. This is our time. Let<U+0092>s use our vote, our power, to choose the America we can be<U+0097>and the future our children and grandchildren deserve. 
https://t.co/oMZpXEo39h. Now is the time to stand up. 
Now is the time to speak out. 
Now is the time to vote.

Your voice is your power<U+0097>don<U+0092>t let anyone take it away.. The thing Donald Trump fears the most is not @JoeBiden or me. It<U+0092>s the power of the people.

We need your help talking to more voters and reminding them to go vote today: https://t.co/UdLsAsky2K. .@JoeBiden knows that no matter where we come from or where we live, no matter our race or gender, background or faith; no matter how we identify or who we love; no matter the language your grandmother speaks<U+0097>what we have in common is so much stronger than what divides us.. <U+260E><U+FE0F> 1 (833) 336-8683 <U+260E><U+FE0F> 

If you have any questions or concerns about voting, call our hotline. Our team of volunteers are ready to assist you.. One day, our children and grandchildren are going to look us in the eye and ask what we did in this moment. 

And I want to be able to say, we did everything we could to fight for our country and their future. Go vote.. The 2016 election was lost by small margins in a few key battleground states. We need your help to remind voters what<U+0092>s at stake, and that their voice matters. Make calls today: 
https://t.co/UdLsAsky2K. Now is your chance to elect a leader who will:

<U+2705>Work to stop the virus
<U+2705>Defend reproductive rights
<U+2705>Build an economy that works for working people
<U+2705>Protect health care
<U+2705>Unite the nation

VOTE: https://t.co/VbrfuqVy9P. Whether it<U+0092>s bringing an end to the pandemic, building a fairer economy, or protecting people with pre-existing conditions, there<U+0092>s so much at stake.

Reply to this tweet to tell me why you voted.. .@JoeBiden and I come from different backgrounds, but we were raised with the same values:

Hard work. 
Honesty.
Decency. 

And these are the values I've seen as I've traveled across our country over the past 85 days. https://t.co/vSc90m3X7w. When @JoeBiden and I are in the White House we<U+0092>ll listen to scientists, promote masks to save lives, implement nationwide testing and tracing, and ensure vaccines are free to all.. Today we must vote like our lives depend on it. Because they do. 

We must vote like our democracy depends on it. Because it does. 

And we must vote like justice, equality, and opportunity are possible. Because they are.. Don<U+0092>t allow anything to come between you and your vote. If you have any questions or concerns about voting, reach out to our voter hotline.

<U+260E><U+FE0F> 1 (833) 336-8683. If you<U+0092>ve already voted, thank you. But we still need your help. Take 20 minutes to help voters in critical battleground states find their polling location. This election is too important to leave anything to chance. 
https://t.co/Rl564rSmA6. Election Day is here, and polling places across the country are starting to open. Mask up and find your polling place at https://t.co/VbrfuqVy9P..

Don<U+0092>t let anyone take away your power. 
Now is the time to stand up. 
Now is the time to speak out. 

And now is the time to VOTE.. Nine months into this pandemic and the current occupant of the White House still doesn<U+0092>t have a plan to contain it.

Instead, he's in court trying to end the Affordable Care Act and tear health coverage away from over 20M Americans.. Our health, our economy, our children's futures, even what kind of country we want to be is all on the line<U+0097>and the decision we make in this election will be felt for generations.. Tomorrow will be a turning point. A chance to unite as a country.

https://t.co/PrMS9MoSlF. Donald Trump wants you to deny reality. To pretend that, during a global pandemic, you don<U+0092>t see the bills piling up or the empty chair where a loved one used to sit. 

The only thing we<U+0092>re going to deny is his chance at a second term.. When this is all over, future generations will ask you what you did to help end the division and chaos of the last four years. Tell them you worked your heart out to make Donald Trump a one-term president. Help us win by making calls to voters now: https://t.co/UdLsAsky2K. It<U+0092>s our last day to get out the vote before the election.

Unlike the current president, Joe is actually prepared to fight COVID-19 with a plan that follows science and prioritizes public health<U+0097>not politics.. 54 cents.

That<U+0092>s how much Latinas earn on average compared to every dollar a white man earns. That<U+0092>s unacceptable. A Biden-Harris administration will fight to close the gender wage gap once and for all. #LatinaEqualPayDay. Your health isn<U+0092>t just what you experience from the neck down<U+0097>it<U+0092>s also from the neck up.

Only 6 more days to elect @JoeBiden, restore our economy, and save the soul of the nation. Join me and supporters in Tucson as we fight for a brighter future. https://t.co/Y6CvDpc2iu.

To the tens of thousands under evacuation orders, please listen to local officials. Stay safe.. Today Republicans denied the will of the American people by confirming a Supreme Court justice through an illegitimate process<U+0097>all in their effort to gut the Affordable Care Act and strip health care from millions with pre-existing conditions.

We won<U+0092>t forget this.. Instead of working to provide COVID-19 relief to struggling Americans, Mitch McConnell and Republicans chose to jam through a Supreme Court nominee<U+0097>when more than 62 million people have already voted. It<U+0092>s despicable and they must be held accountable.. The current occupant of the White House would rather ignore the pandemic than admit he mishandled it. https://t.co/I8EEr7pXww.

It<U+0092>s this simple: Republicans are trying to bypass the will of voters and have the Supreme Court dismantle the Affordable Care Act.. Almost a year ago, @MindyKaling invited me to her home to cook masala dosa and talk politics. While we couldn<U+0092>t catch up in the kitchen this time, I loved having the chance to connect with her on food, family, and<U+0097>of course<U+0097>voting in the most important election of our lifetime. https://t.co/xU11hrwbwZ.

Took a little time from the campaign trail to view some photos throughout my life<U+0097>the people and places that made me who I am today. https://t.co/XfyU8c7SYV. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the harsh truth: we don<U+0092>t pay teachers nearly enough for their time, talent, and skills. @JoeBiden will make sure our teachers are paid what they deserve. https://t.co/Bi4SNB5M4R. It wouldn<U+0092>t be a true Avengers reunion without speaking my friend Chadwick Boseman<U+0092>s name. We missed him dearly this week. https://t.co/SpuFzSlcDY. There<U+0092>s nothing like homecoming at an HBCU. Join us live for our HBCU Homecoming Rally hosted by @TiffanyHaddish with messages from @SHAQ, @ASAPferg, and more special guests. https://t.co/iC6etbnWgT. Honored to share a space with @ReverendWarnock, @Ossoff, @lucymcbath, and more for a mobilization rally in Atlanta. Tune in live. https://t.co/N9jvUxUyfH. More than 223,000 people have died from coronavirus. Trump still doesn<U+0092>t have a plan. We need a real leader in the White House who will listen to the scientists &amp; protect Americans<U+0097>that<U+0092>s @JoeBiden. https://t.co/cNdq3U4TTq. When our children and our grandchildren ask us what we did in this moment in time, we won<U+0092>t tell them just how we <U+200B>felt<U+200B><U+0097>we will tell them <U+200B>what we did. https://t.co/uSCAXCAe6w. With only 11 days until Election Day, I<U+0092>m thrilled to be heading to the Peach State. See you soon, Georgia!. Tonight, @JoeBiden not only won the debate<U+0097>he took a stand against Trump and all of the harm this administration has caused. Join us in this fight by adding a donation:
https://t.co/NBGK8d5nTq. Just last <U+200B>month,<U+200B> Donald Trump stood on a<U+200B> debate stage <U+200B>and refused to condemn white supremacists.

This isn<U+0092>t the first time he<U+0092>s been an apologist for racists. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.. Donald Trump launched his campaign with hateful attacks against immigrants. Then he:

Enacted the Muslim ban.
Demanded funding for a wasteful border wall. 
Separated children from their parents at the border.

This is who he is. He must be voted out.. Our campaign is powered by grassroots donors. Chip in tonight to show @JoeBiden you<U+0092>re in his corner:
https://t.co/NBGK8d5nTq. Let<U+0092>s be clear: Trump knew in January how deadly and lethal coronavirus could become<U+0097>and deliberately misled the American people. 

Now more than 222,000 people are dead.. If a Black child has a Black teacher by the end of third grade, they<U+0092>re 13% more likely to go to college. I<U+0092>m living proof of that and the power of HBCUs. https://t.co/cNA4rQGPoX. Everything from our reproductive rights to the future of equal pay is at stake in this election. Let<U+0092>s use our voice and do everything we can in these last 12 days to get out the vote. https://t.co/IhDZIUdNwT. This Stuttering Awareness Day, I<U+0092>m thinking of these two who<U+0092>ve overcome so much and have shown the world that a stutter doesn<U+0092>t define who you are. 
https://t.co/O8bq4kL3tE. My Democratic Senate colleagues and I boycotted the Supreme Court nominee committee vote today. Let's be clear: this nomination process is a sham and shows how Republicans will stop at nothing to strip health care from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions.. Why<U+200B> would an incumbent president who has been in office <U+200B>for four years<U+200B> try to discourage people from voting?

It<U+0092>s because he knows he cannot run on his record. He knows that, if enough people vote, he will lose<U+200B>.. We're just days away from the end of the election. Help us bring it home by donating $20 today: https://t.co/8PgmcycqAS https://t.co/sji6FREE4b. 545 children. 

This is outrageous and a stain on our national character. Families belong together. 
https://t.co/VsimNG653X. This is our moment to do something for our families, our communities, and our country. To protect our health care, tackle climate change, and build back better<U+0097>but it starts with voting. Tune in. https://t.co/c6iT7yxmUe. .@BarackObama knows that the election is happening right now and winning will require all of us coming together. Tune in live from his drive-in rally in Philadelphia. https://t.co/tujOv9UE6g. .@JoeBiden and I want to get your kids back to school as quickly and safely as possible. This starts with masks and rapid testing, science-based safety guidelines<U+200B>, and emergency funding<U+200B> to ensure our schools have the resources they need to keep students and staff safe.. With only 13 days to go until Election Day, I<U+0092>m in Asheville, North Carolina for a <U+0093>get out the vote<U+0094> event. Tune in now. https://t.co/CGZOKFVLwZ. How will I ever be able to top yesterday<U+0092>s birthday? 

A big thank you to @DonCheadle, @ChrisEvans, @MarkRuffalo, @RobertDowneyJr, @zoesaldana, @Russo_Brothers, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Rudd, and all of our grassroots supporters for making it so special. https://t.co/NVuc6f8QY2. Loved chatting with @CurlyVee to talk pupusas, politics, and our Zodiac signs. More to come soon with @BFPeroLike and @BuzzFeed. https://t.co/ALocq7aVgK. As president, @JoeBiden will restore the soul of our nation and bring decency back to the White House. But we only have two more weeks to make that happen. Tune in now to our virtual Wisconsin rally. https://t.co/VnvZeYxesn. Enjoyed sitting down with @NBA players @CJMcCollum, @spidadmitchell, and @tobias31 to discuss critical issues facing our country<U+0097>including the power your vote holds in this election. Watch our conversation:
https://t.co/cFdmQhuE4v. Trump and Pence are doing everything they can to rip away health care for millions of Americans in a global pandemic. When elected, @JoeBiden and I will do everything we can to ensure health care is a right for all<U+0097>not a privilege for the few.. As a huge Avengers and Black Panther fan, I could not be more excited for our grassroots fundraiser tomorrow with @doncheadle, @chrisevans, @markruffalo, @zoesaldana, the @Russo_Brothers, Scarlett Johansson, and Paul Rudd.

Chip in any amount now: https://t.co/WhxiefvKXS. More than 219,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 and we've seen the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The stakes could not be higher in this election. Join me live from Florida. https://t.co/XfO5VX1tyw. The @JoeBiden-Harris plan won't increase taxes on anyone making less than $400K and asks the super wealthy and big corporations to pay their fair share.. Many Americans aren<U+0092>t sure how they<U+0092>re going to pay rent at the end of the month. The Senate should be working day and night to provide economic relief<U+0097>instead, they chose to rush through a Supreme Court confirmation.. HBCUs, like Shaw University, have nurtured and challenged students for generations. I stand here today on their shoulders. https://t.co/fJ80Jo9zC0. Campaigning may look a little different these days, but what hasn<U+0092>t changed is the American people<U+0092>s determination to fight for a more empathetic, compassionate country. https://t.co/yTslaLQTlD. Black Americans are dying from COVID-19 at 2x the rate of white Americans. 

This pandemic has further reinforced historical inequities in our nation<U+0097>and it is clear that confronting these disparities is not a priority for this administration.. Last month I ran into a few @HowardU seniors when I was visiting campus. To them and all my fellow Bison, happy virtual homecoming<U+0097>know that no matter near or far, your Howard family will always be there for you. https://t.co/Vkve3CJk1n. There is nothing more powerful than a determined group of women marching, protesting<U+0097>and voting. Don<U+0092>t wait: join women across the country today and make your voice heard at the polls. #WomenAreVoting. .@DouglasEmhoff and I wish our Hindu American friends and family, and all those celebrating, a very Happy Navratri! May this holiday serve as an inspiration to all of us to lift up our communities and build a more inclusive and just America.. Americans are suffering from a deadly pandemic and a historic economic crisis. Instead of providing relief to families, Senate Republicans are trying to rush through a Supreme Court nominee in an illegitimate process. Don<U+0092>t forget this.. Trump and Pence want to take health care away from millions<U+0097>and they have no plan to replace it with. Tune in now to hear how @JoeBiden and I will build on the success of the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/Ouxt02CQfY. We are in the middle of an election. More than 20 million Americans have already voted.

It is only right and fair that the American people decide who their president will be<U+0097>and then that person will fill this lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.. Trump has spent full-time spewing hate and division. It<U+0092>s time to end the pain, end the chaos, and elect @JoeBiden. https://t.co/XpGfxpjcY3. .@JoeBiden will be a president for all Americans. Chip in now to help make the Biden-Harris administration a reality. 
https://t.co/96YADz3bZf. Under the Trump administration, LGBTQ+ rights have been under attack. We must first undo the harm of this administration, then do more to protect LGBTQ+ Americans<U+0097>especially trans women of color<U+0097>from discrimination, harm, and death.. Mere days after the election, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the Republican-led case to overturn the Affordable Care Act.

Health care is on the ballot.. Help us power our campaign to victory. Give $5, $15, or whatever you can now: https://t.co/96YADz3bZf. .@JoeBiden and I believe the economy is doing well when our workers and our families are doing well. That<U+0092>s why our tax plan won<U+0092>t <U+200B>raise taxes on anyone making under $400K<U+200B> and will cut taxes for middle-class families.. Here are the facts:
<U+2192>8M Americans infected and over 217,000 dead
<U+2192>Over 25M on unemployment
<U+2192>400,000 small businesses permanently closed
<U+2192>Frontline workers are risking their lives every day 

The Trump administration knew in January and made the decision to cover it up.. It<U+0092>s been over a week since I stepped off the debate stage and gave Bruce a call. I hope to try his sister<U+0092>s cooking someday. https://t.co/yLlbPK8Re5. To all LGBTQ+ youth who are facing bullying and harassment, know that you deserve to be accepted and loved just as you are. #SpiritDay. I will be transparent with you about any test results that I do receive. In the meantime, remember: wear a mask, practice social distancing, and wash your hands regularly. It is possible to stop the spread.. Both the crew member and the staff member were wearing N95 masks at all points they were near me, and our doctors believe that we were not exposed under CDC guidelines. Out of an abundance of caution, I will cancel travel through Sunday and continue to campaign virtually.. Late last night, I learned a non-staff flight crew member &amp; a member of my team tested positive for COVID. I wasn<U+0092>t in close contact<U+0097>as defined by the CDC<U+0097>with either during the 2 days prior to their positive tests.

I've had 2 negative tests this week &amp; am not showing symptoms.. People are scared. They<U+0092>re scared what will happen if the Supreme Court destroys the Affordable Care Act in the middle of a pandemic. They're scared what Amy Coney Barrett's nomination means for Roe v. Wade.

I<U+0092>m talking about all this and more on @maddow at 9pm ET tonight.. Chief Justice John Roberts said in Shelby County v. Holder that no one doubts discrimination in voting still exists. I asked Judge Barrett whether she agreed with that statement or not. 

She refused to comment.. Amy Coney Barrett will admit that COVID-19 is infectious. She<U+0092>ll admit that smoking causes cancer. But whether climate change is real? 

Apparently that<U+0092>s up for debate.. Thank you, @theestallion, for using your voice to speak out. Black women DO deserve better. 

I promise when @JoeBiden and I are elected, we<U+0092>ll continue to show up not just with lip service, but with action.
https://t.co/jZbVxMp3cP. Republicans know the majority of Americans support the Affordable Care Act. So what are they doing? Trying to bypass voters and get the Supreme Court to do their dirty work to overturn the ACA. We can<U+0092>t stand for it.. Today would have been George Floyd<U+0092>s 47th birthday. He should still be alive today celebrating another year with his family and friends. We need justice and to ensure that this never happens again<U+0097>starting with banning chokeholds and creating a national standard for use of force.. I asked Amy Coney Barrett whether she had seen or heard statements before her nomination from Donald Trump promising to nominate judges who would rule against the Affordable Care Act.

Her answer? <U+0093>I don<U+0092>t recall.<U+0094>. During her confirmation hearing, Justice Ginsburg said the right to choose was <U+0093>essential to women<U+0092>s equality.<U+0094>

We already know where Judge Barrett stands on a woman<U+0092>s right to choose. Her writings made it clear. It would be a disgrace to appoint her to Justice Ginsburg<U+0092>s seat.. There are only 21 days left until Election Day. Now is the time to think about when, where, and how you<U+0092>re going to vote. Join @JoeBiden as he talks with Floridians about making a plan to vote. https://t.co/o37Vhf9pri. My mother always used to tell me, <U+0093>Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you are not the last.<U+0094>
https://t.co/spdXyDlIJO. Republicans want to strike down the Affordable Care Act. If they succeed, you could have to pay for mammograms, cancer screenings, and birth control. Young adults aren<U+0092>t guaranteed being on their parents<U+0092> plans. Seniors could pay more for prescription drugs. It's all at stake.. The morning after our first date, @DouglasEmhoff emailed me a list of his available dates for the next couple of months: 'I want to see if we can make this work.' And we did.

Dougie, happy birthday. I could not imagine anyone else I<U+0092>d rather be with on this journey called life. https://t.co/fh94VL4Uzk. The majority of Americans believe that the next president should fill the vacant Supreme Court seat. 

@JoeBiden and I stand with them.. Senate Republicans haven<U+0092>t lifted a finger for 150 days to help the millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table during a pandemic<U+0097>yet they<U+0092>re trying to rush through a Supreme Court confirmation hearing. You see where their priorities lie.. It<U+0092>s because of @BarackObama and @JoeBiden that over 20 million Americans have gained health care coverage and people with pre-existing conditions are protected from being charged more or being denied coverage. That<U+0092>s on the line. https://t.co/0LfHyea2YR. Here is what<U+0092>s at stake with this Supreme Court nomination:

Voting rights.
Workers<U+0092> rights. 
Consumers<U+0092> rights.
Safe and legal abortion.
And so much more.

We must listen to the American people and confirm a new justice after voters decide who they want in the White House.. This Supreme Court nomination process is illegitimate and deliberately defies the will of the people. Republicans will stop at nothing to jam through a nominee who will take health care away from millions of Americans during a global pandemic.. Three years ago today, Trump signed an executive order undercutting the Affordable Care Act. 

Today, he<U+0092>s in court trying to get rid of the ACA and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions<U+0097>and rushing through a Supreme Court justice who will help ensure that.. Together we can build a community that is strong and decent, just and kind<U+0097>one in which we can all see ourselves. 
https://t.co/fQTXSPJBwL. The Supreme Court makes decisions that impact millions of Americans for generations. We must ensure that the integrity of the court is upheld by not appointing a new justice until we have a new president.. Together, we can build a world where all girls have every opportunity to succeed and thrive. 

And to every girl out there, know that leadership starts at any age. #DayOfTheGirl. On #NationalComingOutDay, we celebrate members of the LGBTQ+ community and remember that, even today, it<U+0092>s not always safe or easy to be publicly out. Out or not, you are loved.. Together, we will build our country back better than before.

It was an honor to make the case for @JoeBiden<U+0092>s and my campaign directly to the American people. https://t.co/44sLWuS4Mb. Our campaign is committed to building a broad coalition of supporters that is diverse and inclusive. Proud to share one of our newest ads, <U+0093>Stand Together.<U+0094> https://t.co/5qFOtLtREe. Tune in live as @JoeBiden gives remarks in Erie, Pennsylvania about how we will get the American economy back on track. https://t.co/ZSj0F0QY5G. With their selection of a nominee to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, Republicans have made it clear: they intend to destroy the Affordable Care Act<U+0092>s protections for more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions and overturn reproductive rights.. Donald Trump and Mike Pence don<U+0092>t have a national testing plan for coronavirus or a national strategy for contact tracing. They failed to lead and, now, more than 213,000 Americans have lost their lives.. On #WorldMentalHealthDay, we affirm that mental health is just as important and real as physical health. Together, @JoeBiden and I will work to expand access to care and put an end to the stigma around mental health.. As a proud graduate of Howard University, I<U+0092>m always excited to hear from HBCU students. We are family<U+0097>no matter which school we call home, or where we pledged. https://t.co/DA4ou2DAuM. The science is clear: social distancing and wearing masks prevents the spread of COVID-19 and saves lives. As we head into fall and winter, we must follow the guidance of medical professionals like Dr. Fauci. Lives depend on it.
https://t.co/XnSarobgDy. Joe Biden has been very clear: he will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year.. Tune in to listen to my conversation with @iambeckyg about the power of your vote in this election: https://t.co/vNjy4bymVy https://t.co/4tKOepPxQM. Young people graduating from college are wondering if they can get a job. People are worried about whether they<U+0092>ll be able to make rent. This is where the American economy is right now, and it<U+0092>s because of the failure of leadership of this administration.. .@JoeBiden and I are in Phoenix kicking off our bus tour to fight for our democracy and bring integrity back to the White House. Tune in now. https://t.co/sL39Q7HoDP. Breonna Taylor was a caregiver. She cared for her grandmother, her family, her community. She was beautiful, inside and out.

Her life was taken<U+0097>unjustifiably and tragically so<U+0097>and her family deserves justice. We must not stop speaking her name.
https://t.co/lTEq9Fk8SA. On January 28, Donald Trump and Mike Pence were informed about the nature of this pandemic. 

They knew it was lethal. 
They knew it was airborne. 
They knew it affects young people.

They knew what was happening<U+0097>and didn<U+0092>t tell you.. Thankful for all of your messages of support. With only 26 days left until Election Day, let<U+0092>s use this moment to dig deep and work harder than ever to win<U+0097>for everything that<U+0092>s on the line. https://t.co/KvREkL4rcI. We need an administration that can heal and unite, not tear us apart. Let<U+0092>s do this together. https://t.co/MCGStCFHRI. Just last <U+200B>week,<U+200B> Donald Trump stood on a<U+200B> debate stage <U+200B>and refused to condemn white supremacists.

This isn<U+0092>t the first time he<U+0092>s been an apologist for racists. This is a pattern. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.. I will always fight for a woman<U+0092>s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not Donald Trump<U+0092>s.. The American people want us to fill a seat right now<U+0097>but it<U+0092>s not on the Supreme Court; it<U+0092>s the one in the Oval Office.. Donald Trump called John McCain a <U+0093>loser.<U+0094>

He let Putin get away with placing bounties on the heads of our troops.

He called fallen soldiers <U+0093>suckers.<U+0094>

It's a pattern. And it proves just how unfit he is to be commander in chief.. Donald Trump prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over that of the American intelligence community.. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America's auto industry. And Mike Pence voted against it. So let's set the record straight. 

Thank you.. .@JoeBiden and I believe the economy is doing well when our workers and our families are doing well. That<U+0092>s why our tax plan won<U+0092>t <U+200B>raise taxes on anyone making under $400K<U+200B> and will cut taxes for middle-class families.. The day @JoeBiden asked me to serve with him was one of the most memorable days of my life. My mother<U+0097>who came to the United States at the age of 19<U+0097>I know would be so proud. https://t.co/QdSG66vNO3. Over 210,000 Americans have died. Over 7 million have contracted this disease. Nearly 30 million have filed for unemployment. One in five businesses are at risk of closing. 

And this administration still doesn't have a plan. https://t.co/iqcpXHAIya. Trump didn<U+0092>t share information about the virus because he wanted you to stay calm. 

I want to ask you: how calm were you when you were hunting for toilet paper? How calm were you when your children couldn<U+0092>t see their grandparents because you were afraid they could kill them?. How Donald Trump and Mike Pence handled the coronavirus crisis is the greatest failure of any American presidency.. Before I step on stage, join @MindyKaling, @PadmaLakshmi, @DJCassidy, members of my family, and more guests for a pre-debate event to find out how you can get involved over these last four weeks. https://t.co/mnA9oImLif. @taylorswift13 @vmagazine @inezandvinoodh Voting never goes out of style.

P.S. Please share your cookie recipe.. Together, we can build back better and bring our country together<U+0097>but it starts with getting everyone you know to vote. RSVP now to join @MindyKaling, @PadmaLakshmi, and @DJCassidy before the debate starts tonight. 
https://t.co/ECX1GBg5Wp. People have asked me what they can do in the final 28 days of this election, and here<U+0092>s what I say: make more phone calls. Send more texts. Reach out to more of your friends and neighbors. Tell them why this election matters to you. Every conversation helps.. Trump turned his back on millions of Americans who are struggling to get through this global pandemic and desperately needed relief. 

If you can, vote early<U+2192> https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt. https://t.co/2hY39Lox1G.

https://t.co/2SQJipqzBj. The Biden-Harris plan to get coronavirus under control includes: free COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccines for everyone.. .@JoeBiden is right<U+0097>masks matter. Wearing a mask can save lives. Do it for yourself and for those around you.. Everything we care about: health care, combating the climate crisis, racial justice, and more is on the ballot. 

Take that as even more of a reason to show up<U+0097>and show up early. Vote in numbers no one has ever seen before. With your help, we can build our country back better.. The people I get to hear from while traveling across our country give me the inspiration to keep working for a better tomorrow. https://t.co/lQJcptAPcr.

Just days after the election the Supreme Court will hear a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.

It<U+0092>s a decision that could take away health care for 20M Americans and take away protections for pre-existing conditions. We must fight this.. Farm workers are essential workers<U+0097>they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, especially as they work through these awful conditions. https://t.co/udKW1SQQpw.

This virus is still very much active across our country, please continue to wear a mask and maintain social distancing.. Doug and I join Joe Biden and Dr. Biden in wishing President Trump and the First Lady a full and speedy recovery. We<U+0092>re keeping them and the entire Trump family in our thoughts.. Could not be more thrilled<U+00A0>that one of my favorite actors, @michaelb4jordan, is joining<U+00A0>@BarackObama and me for our first grassroots fundraiser together. Join us: https://t.co/rHnHcVXM09 https://t.co/AK47QDslYG. Voters would simply like to have the opportunity to vote for their President before the Senate votes on a Supreme Court nominee. That<U+0092>s not too much to ask.

But Trump and his party aren<U+0092>t interested in hearing the will of the people.. North Carolina, we may have been socially distanced but I have never felt closer and more excited to be with you. Let<U+0092>s harness this energy and get everyone we know to vote early. https://t.co/Lu0AecwEoM. As California Attorney General, I refused to stand in the doorway of the wedding chapel blocking couples from marrying the person they love. https://t.co/1ruSQo2mUo. .@BarackObama, can't wait to get together and talk about what's at stake in this election and why voting early is so important.

Get your tickets now to join our grassroots fundraiser: https://t.co/rHnHcVXM09 https://t.co/dXMwffRva7. My heart was so full speaking with @HillaryClinton about Ruth Bader Ginsburg's legacy and the ongoing fight for equality under the law. And, of course, we talked quarantine cooking. Listen to our conversation on Hillary<U+0092>s new podcast, #YouAndMeBoth.
https://t.co/VAPMn2OoN5. @chrissyteigen @chrissyteigen, @johnlegend, Luna, and Miles<U+0097>Doug and I are deeply sorry for your loss. Words can never be enough, but know that we<U+0092>re keeping you in our prayers.. It<U+0092>s been three years since our nation was rocked by the worst mass shooting in modern American history. 60 precious lives were cut short in Las Vegas, leaving behind families who will never be the same.

Let<U+0092>s honor their lives and bring an end to the gun violence epidemic.. Donald Trump is weak. 
 
He knows he can<U+0092>t win if the people vote. 
 
So he is throwing up every roadblock he can to suppress the vote.  
 
We, the people, can<U+0092>t let him get away with it.. Last night, @JoeBiden showed that, unlike Trump, he is ready to lead our country on day one. Watch a recap from last night<U+0092>s debate.
https://t.co/eo3LZzO8hO. Donald Trump is not pretending to be anything other than what he is: someone who will not condemn white supremacists.. To the people who ask if Trump is dog-whistling to white supremacists: he<U+0092>s dog-whistling through a bullhorn. https://t.co/UEMkyXyCKD. Tonight, America was presented with a choice: a leader who offers a clear path forward vs. an angry, interrupting bully. https://t.co/2jDrnZLarF. We are in the battle for the soul of our nation, and the choice in this election was made crystal clear during tonight<U+0092>s debate. Donate right now to help @JoeBiden and me defeat Trump. 
https://t.co/LPKuo85v56. We cannot afford to leave a single moment<U+0097>or a single vote<U+0097>to chance over the next 35 days. Make a plan to vote, and vote early if you can. Visit https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt for voting information in your state.. Trump has inflamed the racial divides in our country these past four years. But getting Trump out of office won<U+0092>t be enough. @JoeBiden and I have a plan to root out systemic racism across our laws and institutions<U+0097>in everything from policing to housing.. .@JoeBiden spoke truth when he told the American people: <U+0093>This is not about my family or his family. It<U+0092>s about YOUR family.<U+0094>. Science shows that wearing a mask doesn<U+0092>t just protect you<U+0097>it protects others.

Wearing a mask isn<U+0092>t just the right thing to do, it<U+0092>s patriotic. https://t.co/2Al9IhOkI2. Trump knew. 
He knew COVID-19 passes through the air.
He knew it was deadlier than the flu.
He knew it was dangerous to everyone.

Yet he purposely downplayed the pandemic<U+0097>and now more than 205,000 Americans are dead.. Let<U+0092>s be clear: the next Supreme Court Justice could determine health care for over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, reproductive rights, and so much more. We can<U+0092>t let those rights be trampled.. At 9pm ET tonight, @JoeBiden will face off against Donald Trump in their first of three debates. I know Joe is going to bring everything he<U+0092>s got to that debate stage tonight, and fight for our values with honor and decency. Tweet below to wish Joe good luck tonight.. Not only was Beau Biden an incredible lawyer, he was a dear friend who fought alongside me every step of the way during the foreclosure crisis. https://t.co/JmPww8QZeC. Because of Justice Ginsburg, people could get the job of their dreams, earn equal pay for their work, marry the person they love, and enjoy the full rights and privileges of citizenship that they deserve<U+0097>free of discrimination.
 
Her legacy is at stake.. More than one million Americans have already voted in the election. They have a right to elect their next president who will make a decision about the vacancy on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/uJtZunOXML. Vote as if your life, your choice, depends on it<U+0097>because it does.

Make it clear to Trump and to every Republican Senator that, if they<U+0092>re determined to get rid of your health care, you<U+0092>ll be just as determined to vote them out of office.. It<U+0092>s inexcusable that so many Americans<U+0097>including those working on the front lines to combat this deadly pandemic<U+0097>paid more in taxes than this president did in 2016 or 2017. https://t.co/WxQzhKKOT9. It<U+0092>s not complicated: voters should have the opportunity to vote for President before the Senate votes on a nominee. https://t.co/fA6NjAlOxK. The outcome of this election affects every part of your life and every branch of government<U+0097>with consequences that can last generations.

Tune in tonight at 10pm ET to @TheLastWord with @Lawrence where we'll discuss this, the Supreme Court, Trump's taxes, and more.. Justice Ginsburg was known to pose the question, <U+0093>What is the difference between a bookkeeper in the Garment District and a Supreme Court justice?<U+0094> Her answer: <U+0093>One generation.<U+0094>

Replacing her with a justice who would threaten that progress and her legacy would be a travesty.. Trump and the Republicans have made it clear they will pick a justice who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act. It's a decision that could have devastating consequences for Americans across our country. https://t.co/7ZpMjNgjjD. LIVE: I<U+0092>m joining our Sister to Sister meets Shop Talk series. Tune in now to hear directly from Black North Carolinians about how your vote can make a difference. https://t.co/7ekvknNm8Z. We can<U+0092>t let the infection that Trump has injected into the presidency and Congress<U+0097>which has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other<U+0097>spread to the Supreme Court.

This election is about more than the presidency or the Senate: it<U+0092>s about our democracy.. Trump and Republicans<U+0092> relentless obsession with overturning the Affordable Care Act<U+0097>driven entirely by a blind rage toward President Obama<U+0097>is especially damaging at a moment when the country is suffering through a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives.. Trump and the Republicans are about to learn something. They may feel they have the power in this country. 

But they don<U+0092>t. 

The American people have the power<U+0097>at the ballot box.. When Justice Ginsburg passed away, not only did we lose a giant from the Court, but from American life. Few people in our history have done more to change more lives than she did as a lawyer, an advocate, and a Supreme Court Justice.

She was an inspiration for each of us.. American people deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to the next justice who serves on the Supreme Court. Tune in now as I respond LIVE to Trump<U+0092>s nominee. https://t.co/I2bHYRXMTQ. When young children see someone who looks like them running for office, they see themselves and what they can be, unburdened by what has been. https://t.co/SSpPkkmrmq. To everyone across the country and around the world observing Yom Kippur, @douglasemhoff and I are wishing you a meaningful and easy fast. L<U+0092>Shana Tovah.. If we want safe communities we have to invest in the health of communities, including access to health care and mental health care. https://t.co/44uOtI5yLq. From the beginning, Trump knew how deadly coronavirus was<U+0097>but he lied to the American people about the threat it posed. As a result, America now has more than 7 million cases. Over 204,000 people have died.

We need a president who will take this virus seriously<U+0097>that<U+0092>s @JoeBiden.. In the midst of a global pandemic, Trump is trying to ram through a Supreme Court justice who could determine health care for more than 100M Americans with pre-existing conditions. Tune in as @JoeBiden gives remarks on the U.S. Supreme Court. https://t.co/BEgimdUtXP. I<U+0092>m a huge fan of everything from Fast &amp; Furious to Jumanji, so this endorsement means a lot to me. Welcome to Team Joe, @TheRock. https://t.co/iZwDAHGANN. Trump<U+0092>s hand-picked successor to Justice Ginsburg<U+0092>s seat makes it clear: they intend to destroy the Affordable Care Act &amp; overturn Roe. This selection would move the court further right for a generation &amp; harm millions of Americans.

I strongly oppose Judge Barrett<U+0092>s nomination.. Back on Track gave people a chance to get back on their feet. Their hope for the future gave me hope. https://t.co/UsCFlyZyPa. My advice to my 28-year-old self: appreciate the time you have with your family and friends when you have it. 
https://t.co/rMyFy1lQnG. It<U+0092>s in these moments that our shared humanity and belief in our own power to bring about change guides us forward. That<U+0092>s what I saw on the ground in Flint, Oakland Country, and Detroit earlier this week. https://t.co/mayTcWJwG4. Because of smartphones, the rest of the world is able to witness<U+0097>in vivid detail<U+0097>the injustices our communities have faced for generations. Now you can<U+0092>t turn away without demanding the system be held accountable. https://t.co/65ZAfLurcq. Why are so many powerful people trying to make it so difficult for us to vote? Because they know the power of our vote. https://t.co/EPwQiHdWxA. The outcome of this election will determine the course of our country for generations. Everything from the Affordable Care Act, racial justice, equal rights, and environmental justice is on the ballot. 39 days. Let<U+0092>s mobilize and give this everything we<U+0092>ve got.. At a young age, I was told to look after my sister Maya. I<U+0092>ve carried that with me throughout my life: a strong desire to look after and protect others who need support and help. https://t.co/ghr2EVnXz5. Even after her passing, icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg continues to make history. 
https://t.co/xV97ZzCbTo. In just 40 days, the American people will elect their next president<U+0097>and that president should be the person who makes the decision about who will be nominated to the Supreme Court.. This week was yet another heart wrenching reminder of our urgent need to reform our justice system from the inside out. https://t.co/xBbQJphlV2. Black Americans don<U+0092>t need to be reminded that inequity runs deep in our country. It<U+0092>s a painful reality every day. We will only begin to fully heal when our nation addresses the systemic racism in our laws, policies, and institutions. @JoeBiden and I have a plan to do just that.. .@JoeBiden and I are keeping the police officers who were shot in Louisville in our hearts, wishing them a swift and speedy recovery. Violence is not the answer and we must find a way to express our grief, anger, and demands in ways that reflect the world we wish to see. https://t.co/yLFSAI7Iz4. Tonight, I<U+0092>m thinking of Breonna Taylor<U+0092>s family who is still grieving the loss of a daughter and sister. 

We must never stop speaking Breonna<U+0092>s name as we work to reform our justice system, including overhauling no-knock warrants.. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an icon who used every ounce of life she was bestowed to urge our nation down a path toward equal justice. 

As she lies in repose today, tell me below what her life and legacy means to you.. In high school, I found out my best friend was being molested by her father. One of the reasons I wanted to be a prosecutor was to protect people like her. https://t.co/R51wTtVUAo. The richest 100 Americans made more than $300 billion this year.

The voters must choose a president, and that president should nominate Justice Ginsburg<U+0092>s successor.. When given the chance to address the coronavirus pandemic and save American lives, Donald Trump failed. Now, America now has 6.8M infections, and nearly 200,000 Americans have died.

We need a president who will take this virus seriously. That<U+0092>s @JoeBiden.. Absolutely horrific allegations.

Split a donation between our campaign and @DSCC today. https://t.co/LCxIc4zKJS. This is heartbreaking. Our children deserve a president who will propose real solutions to combat systemic racism within all facets of our society<U+0097>including how we address coronavirus. @JoeBiden will be that president.  https://t.co/P1XBqrL8XC.

There are forces at work trying to make it harder to vote, and we must ask ourselves: why? Because when we vote, things change..

Each day, our nation<U+0092>s courageous firefighters and first responders risk their lives to protect our communities. May this brave soul rest in peace..

https://t.co/TNqAzibPrY. Donald Trump failed in his most basic duty to protect the American people and tell us the truth. It<U+0092>s unforgivable. We deserve real leadership when it comes to combating this pandemic, which is why we must elect @JoeBiden in November. 
https://t.co/5a09MXqfC5. Trump deceived the American people by downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus.

He knew it was airborne. 
He knew it was deadlier than the flu.
He knew young people could get it. 

He knew and he deliberately misled. In November, we must vote him out..

We are a stronger nation because of the contributions of Hispanic Americans like Dolores Huerta, C<e9>sar Ch<e1>vez, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and so many more who have made a lasting impact on our nation<U+0092>s history.

These aren<U+0092>t just numbers on a page. These are real people, with families, plans, dreams<U+0097>all stolen away. My heart aches for their loved ones and their communities.

https://t.co/uPvOR6m70G. 26 years ago today the Violence Against Women Act, authored by @JoeBiden, was signed into law, ensuring survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence have access to the care they need.

Mitch McConnell is refusing to bring its reauthorization to the Senate floor.. My grandparents were phenomenal. My grandfather was a defender of the freedom of India, while my grandmother traveled across India to talk to women about accessing birth control. Their passion and commitment to improving our future led me to where I am today. #GrandparentsDay https://t.co/PA6fmAKr0K. Doug and I are keeping the two Los Angeles County Sheriff<U+0092>s deputies in our hearts as they currently fight for their lives after a horrific attack last night. The perpetrator must be brought to justice. https://t.co/ckuRllMtzv. This is not the time for political games. People are losing their loved ones and their homes, and they need resources to recover. Now. https://t.co/cZu09v00Kh. On Monday at 6 p.m. ET, @HillaryClinton and I are hosting our first virtual grassroots fundraiser together. Looking forward to discussing how we can roll up our sleeves and get to work these last 52 days. Chip in whatever you can to join us<U+2192>
https://t.co/CI73asaqVX. Over the past few years, CA has experienced some of the largest, most destructive wildfires in history<U+0097>fueled &amp; intensified by the climate crisis.

While Trump denies the evidence of this crisis, @JoeBiden will get to work taking the drastic action we need on day 1 to combat it. https://t.co/NNWHl4aJjT. To everyone in California, Oregon, Washington, and throughout the West affected by the devastating wildfires, know that @JoeBiden and I stand with you for however long it takes to recover and rebuild. Stay safe.
https://t.co/fIz5n2RiH3. It<U+0092>s not enough to only recognize those that lost their lives on this day nineteen years ago<U+0097>it<U+0092>s incumbent upon us to also remember the more than 2,000 first responders, workers, and local residents who have since died from 9/11-related illnesses.. May the cherished memory of those we lost on September 11th serve to remind us both of who they were as individuals, but also of who we are as a nation: Brave. Resilient. United. https://t.co/uTBkj9MYBf. Each 9/11, we remember the unbreakable spirit of the American people. We remember the brave first responders and the Americans who lost their lives during those horrific attacks. Even during our darkest moments, we came together to show that hope and love trump fear and division. https://t.co/OuCDKzxIHq. When Trump was saying young people couldn<U+0092>t get coronavirus, he knew they could.

When Trump was saying it was the same as the flu, he knew it was deadlier.

When Trump was purposely downplaying the severity, he knew it passed through the air. 

He knew.. Trump's reckless disregard for the health and safety of the American people has torn apart families and communities. It's unforgivable. https://t.co/Lf43fP9r6T. On #WorldSuicidePreventionDay, know that you are loved and you are never alone. Help is available. If you or someone you know needs assistance, please call 1-800-273-8255..

The stakes could not be higher<U+0097>and we have a lot of work to do over the next 55 days to deliver a mandate that Trump cannot refute. https://t.co/lbRqYiVZQy. As @JoeBiden said earlier today, Trump<U+0092>s choice to knowingly downplay the seriousness of COVID-19 was <U+0093>a life or death betrayal of the American people.<U+0094>

As we mourn the 190,000 Americans who have died, we must also act. Vote him out.. Trump knew in February. 
He knew that COVID-19 passes through the air.
He knew it is deadlier than the flu.
He knew it is dangerous to more than just our elderly and vulnerable.

He purposely downplayed the pandemic. And now, 190,000 Americans are dead.. Donald Trump knowingly betrayed the American people.

His refusal to act cost 190,000 Americans their lives, and tens of millions their livelihoods.

He is unfit to be president. We must vote him out in November. https://t.co/iBwJcqczG7. When @JoeBiden and I are in the White House, we<U+0092>re going to make sure the future is made in America<U+0097>by all of America. Tune in now as Joe Biden gives remarks from Michigan. https://t.co/qWBfJJijyW. The images we<U+0092>re seeing from the West Coast are absolutely horrifying. I<U+0092>m eternally grateful for our brave firefighters who day in and day out risk their lives to protect others, their communities, and homes. Please continue to listen to orders from local officials. https://t.co/1LxUmcsYSh. As president, @JoeBiden will make sure that we treat all American workers as <U+0093>essential<U+0094><U+0097>all the time, not just in times of crisis.. Trump has abdicated his duty and failed to lead on every significant aspect of our country<U+0092>s COVID-19 response. We can<U+0092>t let that happen with a coronavirus vaccine. The stakes are too high to not get this right. https://t.co/tdf296qPbp. Tune in now to the On The Yard Series hosted by HBCU and Black Students for Biden to learn how you can mobilize your friends, family, and communities with 56 days to go until Election Day. https://t.co/hPh6rqAHNL. @BarackObama @JoeBiden Mr. President, thank you for taking the time out of your day to chat about @JoeBiden. Can<U+0092>t wait to see you on the virtual campaign trail!. .@JoeBiden<U+0092>s favorite things aren<U+0092>t just aviators, ice cream, and Amtrak. Thanks, @BarackObama, for giving me the inside scoop on what it<U+0092>s like to work with our next President.
https://t.co/ZoGCkk9OKc. Here<U+0092>s what separates @JoeBiden and me from Donald Trump and Mike Pence: We know that educators, electrical workers, and working Americans are the true backbone of the American economy<U+0097>not CEOs and hedge fund managers. And when elected, we will work every day to deliver for them.. .@JoeBiden is right. We must build a future that not only offers good-paying jobs, but protections and dignity for all workers. https://t.co/eeS5kapK3J. There<U+0092>s no better day than Labor Day to spend time with union members in Wisconsin. The work labor unions do each and every day matters. It's because of them and the determination of workers across our country that we have overtime pay, worker protections, and more. https://t.co/2ZCsMiaOCY. Strong unions built the American middle class<U+0097>everything from a 40-hour work week to paid leave was because of workers who organized and fought. And when @JoeBiden and I are in the White House, advancing worker rights will be a priority.. As the pandemic still rages, essential workers<U+0097>who are disproportionately Black, people of color, immigrants, women, and members of other marginalized communities<U+0097>continue to sacrifice so much. Today, we pay tribute to them. https://t.co/fgMhnAUKqe. This Labor Day, returning to the status quo isn<U+0092>t good enough for American workers and working families. We need to build back better.

That starts with one word: Unions.
https://t.co/a6xUzDqABn. To all the workers who have kept our country going: Thank you. From those essential workers picking up another early shift to front line health care workers working on extra shifts, your nation owes you a debt of gratitude. We will keep fighting for you.. Trump keeps saying the economy is improving<U+0097>but the truth is, only the wealthiest are reaping the benefits. Meanwhile:
<U+2192>Over 100,000 small businesses have closed their doors for good
<U+2192>Almost 30M people are on unemployment
<U+2192>Too many families are unsure how to pay their rent. Howard taught students that we could do anything<U+0097>and that we didn<U+0092>t have to be confined by anyone else<U+0092>s idea of what it means to be Black. https://t.co/bVMoe1ZnSh. Americans are hurting and they need to know their leaders have a plan to help our country recover. @JoeBiden and I will ensure we build back better than before. https://t.co/4tL29p4qzk. We must pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, support automatic and same-day voter registration, and help fund secure state voting systems. 

That<U+0092>s what @JoeBiden and I will do when we<U+0092>re in the White House.. Family means everything to me. I've had many titles throughout my career, but Momala will always be the one that means the most to me. https://t.co/SKDAFeun51. Unlike our two systems of justice under Trump<U+0092>s administration, a Biden-Harris administration will fight for equal justice under law<U+0097>for all. https://t.co/KF2SYv4dHX. Why do you think they don<U+0092>t want us to vote? We all know the answer: It<U+0092>s because they know when we vote, things change. When we vote, we will be seen, we will be heard, and elected officials will be held accountable. VOTE.. This weekend, we must remember that labor built the middle class in our country and lifted up working Americans. We have unions to thank for better wages and safer working conditions. When @JoeBiden and I are in the White House, workers will have us fighting by their side.. Three years ago Trump tried to end DACA.

He failed in the courts, but Dreamers still face uncertainty today.

On day one @JoeBiden will send a bill to Congress to create a path to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11M undocumented people who've strengthened our country for years.. Here<U+0092>s the truth: Donald Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from @BarackObama and @JoeBiden. 

Just like everything else he inherited, he squandered it.. In 60 days, we have a chance to make Trump a one-term president and build our country back better than ever before. Tune in as @JoeBiden gives remarks on how we can create an economy that works for everyone. 
https://t.co/oXuhamUyyT. As we head into Labor Day weekend, please wear a mask, practice social distancing, and wash your hands.

Coronavirus cases are still on the rise in states across our country and these simple acts can protect you, the people you love, and complete strangers.. .@JoeBiden knows firsthand the sacrifices members of our military and their families make for our nation. As president, he will always have their backs<U+0097>just as they've had ours. https://t.co/912n2iHFeh. Thank you Moira from Chicago for drawing this incredible Biden-Harris poster that perfectly captures the spirit of our campaign. 
<U+0001F4F7>: @AngelHHeinz https://t.co/alGyKFHOXx. As @JoeBiden said, the shots fired at Jacob Blake pierced the soul of our nation.

We see the pain and hurt of yet another Black man shot by police<U+0097>and a family with extraordinary courage come together. His family is in my heart today as we continue our fight for justice.. This moment demands leaders who are willing to listen, then lead, so our nation can begin to heal. Tune in as @JoeBiden holds a community conversation in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
https://t.co/74Vcl5Xs9V. It couldn<U+0092>t be more clear: our children's safety is the last thing on Donald Trump's mind.

When @JoeBiden is in the White House, your children will be a priority. https://t.co/P04rpGJsfH. Today marks exactly two months until Election Day. Let<U+0092>s roll up our sleeves and keep making every moment count. Donate if you can. Volunteer to talk to voters. Tell your friends and neighbors what<U+0092>s at stake. 

It<U+0092>s going to take a lot of hard work<U+0097>but together we can win this.. The violence we<U+0092>re seeing right now, the pain we<U+0092>re seeing right now, this is Donald Trump<U+0092>s America<U+0097>not Joe Biden<U+0092>s America.

And oftentimes it has been fanned and encouraged by Trump himself. Don<U+0092>t buy into his fearmongering.. .@JoeBiden is right. The challenges our students, parents, and educators are facing as schools reopen is a national emergency and must be treated as such. 
https://t.co/sxNIK5p1Vv. With only 62 days until Election Day, now is the time to make a plan to vote.

Make sure you<U+0092>re registered at https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt.

Then make your plan. Vote early if you can, either in-person while wearing a mask or by requesting a ballot by mail. Your vote matters.. Everyone wants schools to reopen, but we must prioritize the safety of our students, educators, staff, and families. 

Instead of bullying and threatening schools like Trump has done, @JoeBiden has a plan to reopen and keep them safe.
https://t.co/4omRbhdPm4. Absolutely heartbreaking. Across our country, over 184,000 American lives have been claimed by coronavirus, leaving families and communities torn apart. It<U+0092>s not like this in the rest of the world. All we needed was a competent president.
https://t.co/yEfW8t4C78. Families are packing into their cars in the early morning, hoping the food bank has something left when they get there.  
Children can<U+0092>t visit their grandparents in their last moments.

I<U+0092>m deeply inspired by the new generation of young leaders who are pushing our nation forward. You are patriots who remind us that to love our country is to always strive to make it better. 

Ensure your voices are heard at the ballot box in November.
https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt. The coronavirus advisors Trump is surrounding himself with? One who has been called the <U+0093>anti-Dr. Fauci<U+0094> doesn<U+0092>t have a background in infectious diseases or epidemiology. 

We need new leadership. Lives depend on it. 
https://t.co/fYdfFJrxCi. I<U+0092>ve made a lot of tough decisions in my life, but agreeing to be @JoeBiden<U+0092>s running mate wasn<U+0092>t one of them.

Students across the country can<U+0092>t go back to campus.
More than 110,000 small businesses closed for good.

This is Trump<U+0092>s America.. More than 97% of our campaign is funded by grassroots donations. Ours truly is a campaign powered by people. Every single donation helps<U+0097>no matter the amount<U+0097>so if you can afford to, please consider chipping in today. @JoeBiden and I really appreciate it. https://t.co/r5idR84WdU.

Georgetown coach John Thompson was a legend and a leader both on and off the court, paving the way for so many who came after him. My condolences are with his family, loved ones, and the entire Hoyas community.. Black Panther was more than a movie<U+0097>it was a moment of collective celebration. And that<U+0092>s because of Chadwick. https://t.co/4aptPVyGlX. As we remember the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many more whose lives were cut short, we must commit to reforming policing<U+0097>ensuring officers face accountability and consequence for abuses of power. https://t.co/k1mD4Dz5QV. Thurgood Marshall is a childhood hero of mine. On the 53rd anniversary of the Senate vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court, we recommit ourselves to our shared fight for civil rights, equality, and justice.. The president that Trump has been is the president he will always be. As @JoeBiden said, we have a choice between the light and the dark<U+0097>and I believe America will choose the light. https://t.co/f7OlTMnn8x. I join @JoeBiden in condemning this violence. This can not<U+0097>and must not<U+0097>be who we are. Americans deserve a president who will heal our country and bring people together<U+0097>not fan the flames of hate and division. https://t.co/21h00uFFR7. Jeanette Epps is a trailblazer who will inspire generations to reach for the stars. She may be the first, but she certainly won<U+0092>t be the last.

Watch my full conversation with @AttorneyCrump: https://t.co/CQU6gyq21R https://t.co/tIANReUK0m. Today we remember and honor the life of Ruben Salazar who was a voice for the Chicano movement, an advocate for civil rights, and a journalist dedicated to truth. His life was taken too soon and his legacy lives on in the voices of those standing up and marching for justice.. During his commencement speech at our beloved Howard, my friend Chadwick Boseman said, ""press on with pride and press on with purpose.<U+0094>

In his name, let<U+0092>s keep fighting. 
https://t.co/HU8Q6yQaJ4. From his groundbreaking work in Black Panther to his portrayal of Thurgood Marshall, Chadwick Boseman helped paint a new picture of what<U+0092>s possible. Keeping his family, friends, and fans in my prayers during this difficult time.
https://t.co/yfjfNYWjYD. Heartbroken. My friend and fellow Bison Chadwick Boseman was brilliant, kind, learned, and humble. He left too early but his life made a difference.

That day we had about 5,000 cases as a nation.

...Today we have nearly 6 million.. Unlike Trump, as president @JoeBiden will actually follow the advice of scientists, experts, and economists. https://t.co/F1EqVa8WZf. Emmett Till was abducted and brutally murdered on this day in 1955. He was only 14. 

To this day, lynching is still not considered a federal hate crime. Our country must work to confront this dark, shameful part of our nation<U+0092>s history and right this wrong.. In this election, there are two clear choices: a president who will continue to sow hate and division in our country or @JoeBiden who will work to unify all Americans and restore the soul of our nation.
https://t.co/vYpwonHZ6k.

https://t.co/OJ0uhPLNsm. As President, @JoeBiden will put his coronavirus plan into effect on day one:
<U+2192>Deploy rapid tests with immediate results
<U+2192>Manufacture the medical supplies and PPE we need
<U+2192>Implement a nationwide mandate to wear a mask<U+0097>in Joe<U+0092>s words, not as a burden, but to protect each other. Let<U+0092>s be clear: at the beginning, Trump was convinced if his administration focused on this virus it would hurt the market and hurt his chances of being reelected.

That mattered more to him than saving American lives.. Here<U+0092>s the reality: the United States has nearly six million confirmed cases of coronavirus, 180,000 lives lost, and more than 50 million claims for unemployment this year alone.

It didn<U+0092>t have to be this way. https://t.co/ee61Zr9j2d. Yesterday, @JoeBiden and I spoke with the Blake family. They are an amazing group of people with extraordinary courage.

Even in their pain and grief, even as they seek justice for their son<U+0097>they spoke about the need to end the violence and heal the nation. https://t.co/TybfVXAlVB.

https://t.co/V97WJjivm6. As @JoeBiden said in his acceptance speech, we have a choice between the light and the dark. I believe America will choose the light. 

Let that be our fuel as we go through these next 68 days.
https://t.co/1Nhf6uTbe6. .@BarackObama and @JoeBiden had a program that tracked emerging diseases in places like China. Trump cut it. 

Obama and Biden dedicated a team on the National Security Council to global health security and biodefense. Trump eliminated it. 

It didn't have to be this bad.. Here<U+0092>s the thing about the nature of a pandemic: It<U+0092>s relentless.

You can<U+0092>t stop it with a tweet.
 
If you get it wrong at the beginning, the consequences are catastrophic. And Trump got it wrong from the beginning<U+0097>and then he got it wrong again...and again.. The Republican convention is designed for one purpose<U+0097>to soothe Donald Trump<U+0092>s ego. To make him feel good.

But it<U+0092>s not supposed to be about him<U+0097>it<U+0092>s supposed to be about us. The people.. The numbers that define the crisis we<U+0092>re facing today are staggering:

<U+2192>Nearly 6M confirmed cases of coronavirus
<U+2192>180,000 lives lost
<U+2192>More than 50M claims for unemployment this year alone

We need to see and hear what<U+0092>s happening in our country.. .@JoeBiden and I encourage everyone in California impacted by the wildfires and those in the Gulf Coast affected by Hurricane Laura to continue following guidance from your local authorities to stay safe. We pledge to be there for those whose lives have been turned upside down.. The consequences of Trump<U+0092>s failure to lead and combat the coronavirus have been catastrophic. Tune in now. https://t.co/BB4eVkk3yF. On this day 60 years ago, activists<U+0097>like Rodney Hurst<U+0097>with their hearts set on equality, were attacked in Jacksonville<U+0092>s Hemming Park.

https://t.co/jTr6wDUNGz. Time to roll up our sleeves and get to work to build back a better America. Chip in now. 
https://t.co/Im5gnSBvNG. Trump minimized the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis.
He muzzled public health experts.
And misled the American people.

Now we<U+0092>re all paying the price for his failed leadership.. Let<U+0092>s be clear where Trump and Pence got us: millions out of work, students across our nation who cannot go back to school, and 180,000 lives cut short by coronavirus.. Right now, Donald Trump is in court trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. If he's successful, over 20 million people will lose their health coverage.

Health care justice is on the ballot in November.. On the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, it<U+0092>s more important than ever that we keep up the fight at the ballot box to honor the women who came before us. #FirstWomanVoter https://t.co/ogBkqYLh3l. On Women<U+0092>s Equality Day, the best way to honor the generations of women who paved the way<U+0097>for all of us<U+0097>is to vote, and to continue their fight for all Americans to be able to do the same, no matter their gender, race, age, ability, or zip code. Text VOTE to 30330 to get started.. Getting everyone to vote and safely cast their ballot<U+0097>in person or through the mail<U+0097>will be a full team effort.

Tune in now for our first virtual Sister to Sister roundtable with Black women leaders from across Michigan. https://t.co/0TYrvQmkrT. As a young girl, my grandfather would often take me on his morning walks in India, where he'd discuss the importance of fighting for democracy and civil rights.

https://t.co/WQjCmnEtNz. In 70 days we have the chance to elect a president who will lead with hope<U+0097>not fear<U+0097>and restore dignity and compassion to the Oval Office. 

Chip in now to make that happen.
https://t.co/4jQ3Z1h9l5. As states across our nation continue to attack reproductive rights, especially abortion, it<U+0092>s more important than ever we have a president who will defend and expand these rights.

As president, @JoeBiden will codify Roe v. Wade and protect the constitutional right to choose.. Let's be real clear: Donald Trump failed to take coronavirus seriously from the start. His lack of leadership cost millions of Americans their jobs and led to more than 110,000 small businesses closing for good.

<U+0001F3A8>: Amy Sherald https://t.co/NwXCIbZLGb. For many of our nation<U+0092>s veterans and seniors, the U.S. Postal Service is their lifeline to getting their prescriptions on time. It<U+0092>s despicable delays could leave more than 14M people empty-handed when they need it most.

Protecting the USPS can<U+0092>t wait. 
https://t.co/IcxwByDBcM. We can be the generation that ends gun violence. We can ensure our children never have to live in fear their school will be the next one on the news. But it will require real leadership.

Jacob Blake should not be fighting for his life right now.

The #DemConvention may have ended, but the fight for all Americans and a better and brighter future continues. https://t.co/MUwJtr397G. Tonight, Joe Biden spoke to the moment. Just like he'll do as president for our country. #DemConvention. .@JoeBiden, you<U+0092>re going to make an incredible president.

America, we need your help to make that happen. Can you chip $5, $20, or whatever you can give now? <U+2192> https://t.co/zANt8H5SgF https://t.co/GiENn2TYlr.

Tune in now for the last night of the #DemConvention and be sure to stick around for our after party.
https://t.co/XZpbuU6bxe. I knew @JoeBiden as Vice President, I knew Joe on the campaign trail, but I <U+200B>first<U+200B> got to know him as the <U+200B>father<U+200B> of my <U+200B>friend<U+200B> Beau.

Joe always made sure that his sons were <U+200B>deeply<U+200B>, unconditionally<U+200B> loved, putting in the work day in and day out for them. That's who he is. https://t.co/YOWNpKKir2. While coronavirus touches us all, it is not an equal opportunity offender.

This virus has no eyes, and yet it knows exactly how we <U+200B>see<U+200B> each
other<U+0097>and how we <U+200B>treat<U+200B> each other. 

Let<U+0092>s be clear: there is no vaccine for racism. We<U+0092>ve gotta <U+200B>do<U+200B> <U+200B>the<U+200B> <U+200B>work<U+200B>.. Thanks for all your support last night! Especially to my husband @douglasemhoff, and @JoeBiden and @DrBiden. 

Watch the recap of the third day of the #DemConvention now. https://t.co/K1U7VubK19. There<U+0092>s something happening, all across the country. It<U+0092>s not about @JoeBiden or me<U+0097>it<U+0092>s about all of us and our future. Help us keep up the fight for the country we love by chipping in what you can today. #DemConvention
https://t.co/MsRMP6JTKT. Years from now, when this moment has passed, our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: <U+0091>Where were <U+200B>you<U+200B> when the stakes were so high?<U+0092>

And we will tell them, not just how we <U+200B>felt<U+200B><U+0097>we will tell them <U+200B>what we did. #DemConvention. .@JoeBiden and I are fighting to build a country where we can all see ourselves.

That<U+0092>s the <U+200B>vision<U+200B> our parents and grandparents fought for. 

The <U+200B>vision<U+200B> that made my own life possible.

The <U+200B>vision<U+200B> that makes the American promise<U+0097>for all its complexities<U+0097>worth fighting for.. For George Floyd.
For Breonna Taylor.
For our children.
For <U+200B>all<U+200B> of us.

And for the lives of too many others to name, we<U+0092>ve gotta do the work to fulfill that promise of <U+200B>equal justice under law. Because <U+200B>none<U+200B> of us are free until <U+200B>all<U+200B> of us are free. #DemConvention. I am honored to accept the nomination for Vice President of the United States. 

I do so, committed to the values my mother taught me and to a vision that @JoeBiden shares<U+0097>where all are welcome, no matter what we <U+200B>look<U+200B> like, where we <U+200B>come<U+200B> from, or who we <U+200B>love<U+200B>. #DemConvention. My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives.

She taught us to put family first<U+0097>the family you<U+0092>re <U+200B>born<U+200B> <U+200B>into<U+200B> and the family you <U+200B>choose<U+200B><U+0097>but to also see a world beyond ourselves. #DemConvention https://t.co/xU61nLrUXx. That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me.

Women and men who believed so fiercely in the <U+200B>promise<U+200B> of equality, liberty, and justice for all. They <U+200B>organized<U+200B>, marched<U+200B>, and <U+200B>fought<U+200B><U+0097>not just for their <U+200B>vote<U+200B>, but for a <U+200B>seat<U+200B> at the table.. Speak truth,<U+00A0>@BarackObama. At a time when Americans needed leadership, Trump failed.

It didn't have to be this way.<U+00A0>

https://t.co/eDPkOzTE6s. ""How do you make a broken family whole? The same way you make a nation whole. With love. And understanding. And small acts of kindness.""

Such a touching speech. @DrBiden, I can't wait until you're our next First Lady.. .@AdyBarkan's commitment to fighting for health care for his children Carl and Willow, for your children, and for all our children<U+0092>s children is deeply inspiring. We are stronger with him on our side.
https://t.co/oRK4ELpeXX. After a spectacular roll call that showed the heart and soul of our nation, it's official. Congratulations, @JoeBiden! https://t.co/2yLrvDUMWj. .@staceyabrams: ""Faced with a president of cowardice, Joe Biden is a man of proven courage.""

In November, courage is on the ballot. Empathy is on the ballot. And @JoeBiden is on the ballot. https://t.co/fbcF4qbL1P. This is a moment that demands real leadership. Leaders who listen to experts, tell the truth, and won<U+0092>t shy away when things get tough. @JoeBiden is that leader.

Tune in now for day 2 of the #DemConvention. https://t.co/ItRRcj6AXR. Last night filled me with optimism and hope for our future, something many of us may not have felt in a while. Relive the best moments now and be sure to tune in again tonight at 9pm ET. 
https://t.co/vCKV9MWWnC. Thank you, @MichelleObama, for your kind words and continued leadership. With 77 days to go, every moment counts<U+2192>https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt https://t.co/lcAqngUCoY. It has been one week since @JoeBiden asked me to be his running mate and I could not be more thankful for the outpouring of love and support @douglasemhoff and I have seen. 

Help us keep the momentum going by chipping in whatever you can today.
https://t.co/PsWOIL5lZR. 100 years ago today the 19th Amendment was ratified, but many Black women and women of color were unable to exercise their constitutional right for decades. 

I would not be the Democratic candidate for Vice President without those who fought and paved the way before me. Vote.. A powerful call to action by @MichelleObama. Register to vote now at https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt. #DemConvention https://t.co/Zp9qSnyFlY. .@MichelleObama speaking truth to power.

https://t.co/UDCCofB0Rv. ""The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake. We must come together, defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.""

Thank you, @BernieSanders. Together, we can win.. We may have had our differences on the campaign trail but together we are unified for one common purpose: defeat Donald Trump and elect @JoeBiden to the White House. #DemConvention
https://t.co/ZtpOsykGB8. .@DougJones, @CatherineForNV, and @amyklobuchar's #DemConvention speeches magnified what<U+0092>s at stake in November: the Senate. It<U+0092>s crucial we roll up our sleeves and get to work to flip the Senate in November. Pick a race. Get involved. Every action you take now matters.. Philonise Floyd said it best, ""George had a giving spirit<U+0097>a spirit that has shown up on streets around our nation, and around the world.""

George Floyd<U+0092>s legacy continues to live on through our fight for justice. This is a movement, not a moment. 
https://t.co/5GbUvOknsm. This is why I<U+0092>m with @JoeBiden. He knows what we need to do to dismantle systemic racism in our nation and actually address our community<U+0092>s concerns. https://t.co/fqorlWJlH1. Together we can unify our country and elect Democrats up and down the ballot. Tune in now to watch the #DemConvention. 
https://t.co/YE20uJX0vu. The #DemConvention kicks off tonight with a full lineup of incredible speakers who represent the decency and diversity of our party<U+0097>and the brighter future we can build together under a @JoeBiden administration. Don<U+0092>t miss out. 
https://t.co/9MWysjyttW. As @JoeBiden always points out, this election is about more than politics. It<U+0092>s about who we are as a country. It<U+0092>s about the soul of our nation. Together we<U+0092>ll create millions of jobs, fight the climate crisis, pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, and more.. Nothing that we have ever achieved has come without a fight. And right now, there is so much on the line<U+0097>everything from the future of our economy to whether the Black community will have equal access to a vaccine when it<U+0092>s created. 
https://t.co/up93CI8jwC. There is no question that we need immediate and drastic change in our country. And it starts with electing @JoeBiden on November 3.

Doug and I join the Biden family in sending our deepest condolences and prayers to the entire Trump family during this difficult time. Losing a loved one is never easy but know that we are thinking of you. https://t.co/j9cVKi8b5A. Why don<U+0092>t they want us to vote? Why are they creating obstacles to us voting? 

It<U+0092>s this simple: when we vote things change. When we vote things get better. Vote.. Happy Indian Independence Day! Reflecting on the past 74 years, it<U+0092>s remarkable how much progress our people have made in the fight for justice. I hope you'll join me today in celebrating and then commit to building an even better future.. America needs leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. A president who makes every challenge we face even more difficult to solve.

We don<U+0092>t have to accept that. In 80 days let<U+0092>s elect @JoeBiden and #BuildBackBetter.. Eight years ago today, the first DACA applications were accepted. Dreamers are Americans but they still remain under attack by this administration. On day one as president, @JoeBiden will take action to protect Dreamers from deportation and put them on a path to citizenship.. To all of @JoeBiden's supporters, thank you for being so welcoming to @douglasemhoff and myself these last few days. Electing Joe is just the start of the work ahead of us. I can<U+0092>t wait to see what we can accomplish<U+0097>together. https://t.co/wVgxNFs6Tm. We cannot let Donald Trump destroy the United States Postal Service. Congress must step up to ensure our nation<U+0092>s seniors can get their life-saving medicine on time and that people can safely cast their ballots.. Donald Trump votes by mail but doesn<U+0092>t want you to. If it<U+0092>s good enough for him, it<U+0092>s good enough for us. 
https://t.co/WX1EEBIeel. This election isn<U+0092>t just about defeating Donald Trump or Mike Pence. It<U+0092>s about building our country back better. And that<U+0092>s exactly what @JoeBiden and I will do.

Chip in now to help us win in November. 
https://t.co/np13jGrhqm. Today @JoeBiden and I signed our paperwork to officially get on the ballot in all 50 states. 

But we can't do this alone. Text READY to 30330 to help us win in November. https://t.co/4JLeMTdE6v. 81 days. 81 days to organize, to mobilize, and fight to ensure we can finally say goodbye to the national nightmare we call Donald Trump.. 85 years ago today Social Security was signed into law, but just last week Trump said he<U+0092>ll defund Social Security if reelected. 

The choice in November is clear: we must elect @JoeBiden to strengthen and expand Social Security so our seniors can retire with dignity.. Just look where Donald Trump and Mike Pence got us: more than 16 million out of work. Millions of kids who cannot go back to school. More than 165,000 lives have been cut short by coronavirus, many with loved ones who never got the chance to say goodbye.

This was preventable.. When other countries were following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News. 

Let me tell you this: when @JoeBiden is president he<U+0092>ll listen to the facts. He<U+0092>ll embrace science. And we will all be better for it.. My mother always use to say, <U+0093>Don<U+0092>t just sit around and complain about things. Do something.<U+0094> I dearly wish she were here with us this week. https://t.co/RHO2VnlZs4. Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from @BarackObama and @JoeBiden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.. I was so proud to stand with @JoeBiden earlier today as our party's nominee for Vice President, and I do so mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice, determination, and resilience makes my presence here even possible.. We need more than a victory on November 3rd. We need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be. Chip in now to make that happen: https://t.co/XBTwRmxAem. I<U+0092>m humbled to be joining @JoeBiden in the battle to defeat Donald Trump and build a country that lives up to our values of truth, equality, and justice. Tune in now to watch our first campaign event.<U+00A0>
https://t.co/rWs5tOrD6E. When @JoeBiden launched his campaign for president, he said the tragedy that unfolded in Charlottesville three years ago today<U+0097>and the president<U+0092>s heartless response<U+0097>spurred him to battle for the soul of this nation. 

That battle continues to this day.. The character of our country is on the ballot this year and I<U+0092>m honored to serve by @JoeBiden<U+0092>s side as we fight to rebuild our country back better.

We can do that, but we need your help. Chip in any amount to join our grassroots fundraiser tonight<U+2192> 
https://t.co/2ey803sF0u. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. But together, it's a battle we can win.

@JoeBiden<U+0097>I'm ready to get to work. https://t.co/3PJcUTYBGU. Trump thinks this country belongs to him. But @JoeBiden knows it belongs to all of us. To the people.

We can't do this without you<U+0097>can you chip in today?
https://t.co/xeixljBgE2. .@JoeBiden can unify the American people because he's spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he'll build an America that lives up to our ideals.

I'm honored to join him as our party's nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief.. Black women and women of color have long been underrepresented in elected office and in November we have an opportunity to change that. Let's get to work.
https://t.co/aiVwuBrwqR. Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin<U+0097>today is Primary Day! Be sure to turn in your vote-by-mail ballot and stay safe by wearing a mask if you<U+0092>re heading to the polls. Every single vote makes a difference.. The USPS delivers medicine to our nation<U+0092>s seniors, helps small businesses, and ensures people can safely cast their ballots. 

It should concern everyone that the Trump administration is actively undermining the USPS during a pandemic and right before the November election.. America is desperate for a strong, competent, and honest leader who seizes the moment, takes responsibility, and does everything possible to solve the crises plaguing our country. 

That<U+0092>s why we must elect @JoeBiden on November 3rd.. From fighting against voter suppression to protecting the dignity of work, @ReverendWarnock is the voice that Georgia needs in Washington. Can you chip in now to help him join me in the Senate? Every dollar counts. 
https://t.co/gaM9PnwtqA. @RobertGarciaLB @RobertGarciaLB, my friend, my heart breaks for you and your entire family after another devastating loss. May your stepfather and your mother be your guiding light in the years to come. Doug and I are sending you our love.. This weekend we surpassed 5 million coronavirus cases in the United States. 

...And there is still no adequate national testing strategy. Trump and his administration have failed Americans.. Small businesses across our country rely on @USPS to get their packages to their customers as soon as possible. We cannot let Trump interfere with the Postal Service. 

If you own or work for a small business, share your story about what USPS delays mean to you.. It has been 150 days since Breonna Taylor was murdered in her home. That<U+0092>s 150 days Breonna Taylor's family and friends have grieved what could have been.

We must keep saying her name and demanding justice because the police who killed her still have not been charged.. Great news: my friend @harrisonjaime<U+0092>s race has now been labeled a toss up! It<U+0092>s going to take all of us to flip that Senate seat from red to blue and send him to the Senate. Can you chip in now?
https://t.co/woOD7M6Ui2. Unlike Donald Trump, @JoeBiden recognizes why we are in this fight and actually understands what we must do to dismantle systemic racism in our nation and build a better America. https://t.co/Y0Rr2pGlrV. Horrifying and inexcusable. There is absolutely no reason police officers should be shooting at unarmed children. 

The system must change<U+0097>and that starts with holding officers accountable for misconduct.
https://t.co/D2elZSktUY. Six years ago Michael Brown was killed at the hands of police, sparking a nationwide movement and a desperately needed conversation that we are still having to this day. We cannot give up fighting against police brutality.. 87 days left until Election Day. That<U+0092>s 87 days to make a difference. 87 days to phone bank. To get people registered to vote. To donate to Democratic campaigns up and down the ballot. 

Make these 87 days count.. Trump just promised that if he wins reelection he'll gut Social Security and Medicare.

A vote for @JoeBiden in November means protecting and expanding these benefits<U+0097>ensuring our seniors have the ability to retire with dignity.. It could not be more clear they are trying to take down the United States Postal Service from the inside<U+0097>at a time when we need it the most.

Congress must immediately step up to save the Postal Service and safeguard our elections. There<U+0092>s no time to waste. https://t.co/S3sodtYEpX. Reminder: Trump is actively trying to overturn Obamacare during a global pandemic. His executive order is meaningless.. Once this pandemic is over, we can<U+0092>t go back to the way things were. We need to #BuildBackBetter. 

@JoeBiden has a plan to do that. 

He<U+0092>ll revitalize American manufacturing and create millions of good-paying jobs, ensuring the future is made in America<U+0097>by all of America.. There are two systems of justice when stealing hedge clippers gets a Black man life in prison but the officers who murdered Breonna Taylor are still free.
https://t.co/N1xpJzY9r3. Combat veteran and dedicated public servant @VoteJackie4NY understands the complex issues facing working and middle class families today. We need her voice in Congress. Chip in now to make sure #NY02 has a powerful advocate fighting for them:

https://t.co/YErtvXk0SJ. On the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, there<U+0092>s only one thing to do: register to vote today, then get five of your loved ones to do the same. https://t.co/1Nhf6uTbe6. Trump<U+0092>s bungled pandemic response has cost lives and devastated families from coast to coast. Electing @JoeBiden in November could not be more crucial. 
https://t.co/lPgaNgEfiz. As an educator and former school board trustee, @candacefor24 knows both the struggles and hopes of working and middle-class families. In Congress, I know she<U+0092>ll be a strong advocate for progressive change for #TX24. Chip in now:
https://t.co/hXidbbsnL8. Congratulations @NiaDaCosta on breaking down barriers in the Marvel Universe! I cannot wait to see where you take Captain Marvel 2.

Pence did get one thing right though<U+0097>the future of the Supreme Court is on the ballot in 2020, which is why we must vote for @JoeBiden on November 3rd.
https://t.co/ABKYP9dxhb. The @NRA bought the president and promotes members of Congress that turn a blind eye to the gun violence epidemic.

It takes leaders with courage to stand up to them<U+0097>thank you,<U+00A0>@TishJames. https://t.co/BA1HRkXUBZ. 55 years ago today LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act into law, which aimed to protect the right to vote for all Americans.

Yet in 2013 the Supreme Court gutted a key section of this act and McConnell is currently blocking legislation to restore it. Our work isn<U+0092>t over.. No matter what the Trump administration thinks, the Census is not a game. Generations will suffer if he gets away with this, especially communities of color.

Spread the word to get counted at https://t.co/rRT9qU9Kcp.
https://t.co/jDJBgBqegb. .@xjelliott has dedicated her life to public service, not self-service. From her time as a public school teacher to state legislator, she has what it takes to represent the people of #AR02 and win this competitive race. Help make that a reality:
https://t.co/IomP15SBMU. Incredible victory. Last night Missouri became the 38th state plus D.C. to expand Medicaid to save lives and reduce racial health disparities.

Congrats to @ProjectFairness and advocates on the ground for leading the fight to make this happen.
https://t.co/asIbJBcVQK. The GOP just nominated a pro-Trump Republican to take on Dr. @BarbaraBollier.

Kansas could be one of the four states Democrats need to take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell. Can you chip in now to flip Kansas and send Barbara to Washington?
https://t.co/ovgpmmMsyr. 8 years ago today a white supremacist walked into a Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, WI, fatally shooting 6 people. 

We just honored El Paso and next week is the anniversary of Charlottesville.

How much longer will the rising threat of white supremacy go virtually unaddressed?. 20 million Americans could be at risk of eviction by the end of September.

That<U+0092>s 20% of renters.

It<U+0092>s not enough just to extend the federal eviction moratorium<U+0097>my RELIEF Act would help stop evictions and foreclosures for one year.. @votegardner2020 Congratulations Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner on your victory last night! Onward to November for another four years of fighting for a better and fairer St. Louis for all.. Our path to victory is through Ohio. And that includes electing @TimsDesiree to #OH10. After the tragedy in Dayton, she stepped up and decided to run to ensure no community grieves another mass shooting. Let<U+0092>s make that happen:
https://t.co/k3KKLracXR. Americans deserve a president who has a generous spirit. That's @JoeBiden.

There's nothing about Donald Trump that is generous<U+0097>unless it's to himself. https://t.co/L1gdnaNhdJ. This segment is still etched in my mind. 30 seconds was all it took for nine lives to be cut short in Dayton, Ohio one year ago<U+0097>the second of back-to-back mass shootings. 

One year later and still no comprehensive action to end gun violence.
https://t.co/kgHJKBENhQ. Trump once again shows he has no idea what a fair and honest election looks like. 

Thanks to my friends @jasonfrierson and @govsisolak for pushing forward to ensure all registered Nevadans can cast their ballot without worrying about their health and safety. https://t.co/KC8qWrddPq. Today @JoeBiden released his plan for the Latinx community to ensure they can thrive not just at work but at schools and beyond. I'm joining @MSNBC at 4pm ET to discuss this and more.
https://t.co/wVA1t3BILD. Today is Primary Day in Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and Washington. If you haven<U+0092>t already, be sure to turn in your vote-by-mail ballot and if you<U+0092>re heading to the polls, please wear a mask and maintain social distancing when possible. Your vote and your safety matters.. Over 155,000 Americans have died from coronavirus and Trump argues it<U+0092>s not so bad.

Let<U+0092>s end this national nightmare in 91 days by electing @JoeBiden. 
https://t.co/iOF9sm1Jp9. Happy birthday, @BarackObama! Thank you for continuing to give our country hope and inspiring a generation of young leaders to be the change they want to see in their communities. https://t.co/ZV7AXOTJNa. Tomorrow is Missouri<U+0092>s primary and it is imperative that we do everything we can to help @votegardner2020 win reelection. Let<U+0092>s make sure she can continue fighting the next four years for a better Saint Louis<U+2192>
https://t.co/3LNW7lkbDi. The House passed the HEROES Act more than two months ago and instead of voting on it, Senate Republicans spent 10 weeks coming up with their own bill.

Their ""relief"" bill cuts expanded unemployment benefits, fails to stop evictions, and doesn't include nutrition assistance.. After Mitch McConnell blocked @TimmonsGoodson<U+0092>s nomination to the federal bench<U+0097>despite her overwhelming qualifications<U+0097>she decided to run for #NC08. Pat's unwavering voice for justice is just what we need in the House. Chip in now to make that happen:
https://t.co/Z3vFT6bv2J. One teacher already died from coronavirus. Two more are sick. And the new school year hasn<U+0092>t even started. 

A gut-wrenching read about the impossible decisions our educators are facing. They deserve so much better. 
https://t.co/x2Ol9ccM55. One year ago 23 lives were cut short in El Paso<U+0097>the deadliest attack against the Latinx community in recent American history. An attack fueled by the flames of hate and division. 
 
Gun violence is a national emergency in our country. It must be treated as such. #ElPasoStrong. Justice delayed is justice denied. And justice for Breonna Taylor has been delayed for far too long as the officers who murdered her still have not been arrested. 

Keep up the calls for justice.. Trump<U+0092>s repeated racist rhetoric tries to place blame for his coronavirus failures on anyone but himself. It<U+0092>s dangerous and it<U+0092>s wrong<U+0097>and has real life consequences for Asian Americans and Asian immigrants.
https://t.co/5XIwxivEcr. To confront systemic racism we must confront environmental racism.

The Environmental Justice for All Act I introduced this week would address environmental inequalities and invest long-term in communities that for far too long have been excluded.
https://t.co/mJ07zcEnp0. If Donald Trump is reelected the damage that he has done may be irreparable. 

In 93 days, we must vote for @JoeBiden.. Congress must immediately pass my bill with @BernieSanders and @EdMarkey to get $2,000 a month in Americans' hands. 

We need direct monthly cash payments and we need them now.
https://t.co/q9Tc17td0u. The Trump administration is actively undermining the United States Postal Service ahead of what could be the largest election where people vote by mail.

Congress must immediately step up to support the USPS and take swift action to safeguard our elections. It can<U+0092>t wait.. <U+0093>Despite everything that has happened, I continue to believe in the American Dream. I believe that in America, right matters. I want to help ensure that right matters for all Americans.<U+0094>

Thank you, @AVindman, for serving our country and speaking truth. 
https://t.co/M0dcEwfPPt. Mitch McConnell and the GOP let the additional $600 in unemployment benefits expire. They let the federal evictions moratorium expire. With rent due today, millions aren<U+0092>t sure how they<U+0092>ll pay.

This is why I called for monthly payments back in March.
https://t.co/qIki9CCdVL. Environmental justice is interconnected with every aspect of our fight for justice<U+0097>we cannot disentangle the environment people live in from the lives they live. This is why I introduced a comprehensive environmental justice bill in the Senate.
https://t.co/13IDsppPy7. In 95 days we have a chance to change the future of our nation. To vote in leaders who will champion everything from voting rights reform to tackling gun violence. Chip in now to help our endorsed candidates<U+2192> https://t.co/OsXuHjVfhY https://t.co/5Z8PDNIXLW. Millions of people across our nation are teetering on a cliff right now. Rent is due tomorrow. Bills need to be paid. 

We have the answers already but reckless Republicans won't act: recurring $2k payments, expanded unemployment insurance, and nutrition assistance.. Combating racial inequities must be prioritized<U+0097>and @JoeBiden knows that. His #BuildBackBetter plan would help level the playing field for communities of color by doing everything from investing in minority businesses to raising the minimum wage.
https://t.co/2CcTeetbvd. Election Day will happen in 95 days whether @realDonaldTrump likes it or not. 

But to win the White House and flip the Senate, we have to roll up our sleeves and get to work. Now is the time to register to vote. Donate to a campaign. Phone bank. It matters.. Eid Mubarak to all our Muslim brothers, sisters, and friends celebrating in the United States and around the world. Whether near or far, may this day bring you and your loved ones many blessings.. In the next coronavirus relief package, it's imperative Congress ensures people have basic necessities such as a roof over their head, food on the table, safe and affordable water, and access to the internet.
https://t.co/Zsj0r1CKuB. .@RobertGarciaLB's mother Gaby cared deeply for her patients as if they were members of her own family. If you're able to, please chip in now to ensure her legacy can live on in @CSULB students in health care: https://t.co/LVxlfNOf6H https://t.co/BtV4q9OfNR. I know under a @JoeBiden presidency, our teachers will be valued and given the respect they deserve. 
https://t.co/wZdvTHeTls. There's no more appropriate way to honor the life and legacy of John Lewis than by fighting to expand the rights he almost died for. As @BarackObama said, let's keep marching. 
https://t.co/xgUI7pAaMv. John Lewis left us some final marching orders. Let<U+0092>s carry them with us into November and beyond.
https://t.co/lfYwpIdZEM. Donald Trump is terrified. He knows he's going to lose to<U+00A0>@JoeBiden. It will require every single one of us to make that happen. 

We will see you at the ballot box on November<U+00A0>3rd,<U+00A0>@realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/GeEH6Csvym. We tell people to wear a mask but many communities do not have access to the protective gear they need to keep themselves and others safe. Yesterday I joined @BernieSanders on the Masks for All Act to change that.
https://t.co/GvP5DBCyc6. Republicans<U+0092> coronavirus relief plan sells out working families by slashing the expanded unemployment benefit to $200 and failing to stop evictions and foreclosure<U+0097>all while loosening rules for Big Banks and putting a new FBI headquarters down the road from the Trump Hotel.. This is in direct defiance of the Supreme Court<U+0092>s decision. 

Dreamers, know this: we have your back and will fight to ensure you are protected. You are not alone. 
https://t.co/bNXANLjLRk. We can<U+0092>t have millions of Americans losing their homes in the middle of a pandemic. Here<U+0092>s one way we can deter that from happening: my RELIEF Act would help stop evictions and foreclosures for a year. But we must act now before the eviction crisis gets worse. https://t.co/81c0YNs4zD. Donald Trump ignored early coronavirus warning signs. Dismissed the seriousness of the threat. Attacked the advice of doctors and scientists. Failed to institute an adequate national plan for testing and contact tracing.

Now nearly 150,000 Americans have died. This is on Trump.. We are in a historic economic crisis with no end in sight<U+0097>now is not the time to slash additional unemployment benefits by $400 a week. 

I won<U+0092>t stop fighting for $2,000 monthly payments and extending unemployment benefits.. This is the most important election of our lifetime. With @JoeBiden as president, we'll be able to build an America that lives up to our ideals. https://t.co/q9xVPd2PuF. Can't wait to join @JoyAnnReid on @MSNBC at 7pm ET to chat about @JoeBiden's latest addition to his #BuildBackBetter plan and Barr's testimony today. Don't miss it. 
https://t.co/3FyYPCSr0x. Everyone takes pride in going to the polls on Election Day and getting that I Voted sticker.

But know this<U+0097>many states offer alternative ways to cast your ballot, such as vote-by-mail. This Vote By Mail Day, get your voting plan in place. Too much is at stake to wait.. Watch now: @CedricRichmond pointing out to Bill Barr that actions speak louder than words.
https://t.co/BXaa5dTtqo. The Trump administration<U+0092>s complete mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis has worsened longstanding disparities in our country. Tune in now to hear @JoeBiden discuss how we can combat systemic racism and advance racial economic equity moving forward.
https://t.co/xzbsU07s3j. We have a pivotal election coming up in just 98 days and it<U+0092>s critical colleges take steps now to protect student voting rights and ensure their voices are heard at the ballot box.

Read @marceelias<U+0092> latest:
https://t.co/V0l10khYaE. Americans deserve a president who is compassionate, empathetic, and will fight every single day for working families. That's @JoeBiden. https://t.co/0qxUWzs6O9. Bill Barr<U+0092>s testimony today shows us he<U+0092>s only here to protect the president and his reelection. That<U+0092>s it.. The Republican<U+0092>s coronavirus relief proposal released yesterday fails to stop evictions or foreclosures. People are hurting in America, deeply hurting, and they<U+0092>re worried they<U+0092>re going to lose the roof over their head. My RELIEF Act would help give them peace of mind. https://t.co/SzIGYWWa6H. Over 17 million Americans are unemployed. Just last week we found out an additional 1.4 million people applied for unemployment.

And this is how Trump and Republicans respond. In 99 days let<U+0092>s vote them out.
https://t.co/bD7CPWAjRj. Congrats to the over 45,000 California child care providers who had the chance to vote for their union<U+0097>and won!

Tune in at 12:35am ET to @LateNightSeth as I discuss the solutions we can implement to make a difference in people's lives and ensure they can stay safe and in their homes during this crisis.. Adrian Perkins has fought for our country and now he wants to take that fight to the Senate to build a better Louisiana for all. Watch his video and chip in a few bucks if you can.   
https://t.co/oxcXj3pEM8 https://t.co/SpsMP48o6y. @RobertGarciaLB My dear friend, my heart aches for you and your family. Your beloved mother led an extraordinary life and her compassion touched countless Californians.

Mothers are irreplaceable but I know yours will continue to be a guiding force throughout your life.. All issues are women's issues<U+0097>but from economic security to health care, women are disproportionately impacted. @JoeBiden knows that. The comprehensive plan he released today will help to further women<U+0092>s economic and physical security. We can't leave anyone behind. https://t.co/ivoZZyNpxN. On his final trip to the Capitol, John Lewis' funeral procession stopped at the Lincoln Memorial, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, Black Lives Matter Plaza, and more. 

A touching way to celebrate the #GoodTrouble John Lewis made throughout his life.
https://t.co/PfM1OK05lK. Instead of taking charge during the pandemic, Trump would rather people learn to live with their grandparents dying. Learn to live with their friends on ventilators. Learn to live with boarded up businesses. 

Time to move aside and let real leaders lead.
https://t.co/qOHBcap4x7. The future of the Supreme Court. 
Economic justice for workers.
Combating the climate crisis.

All of these issues and more are on the ballot in 100 days. Register to vote at https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt.. There are only 100 days to go until Election Day. 100 days to get your friends, family, neighbors, and complete strangers to turn out the vote to flip the Senate and elect @JoeBiden to the White House. The stakes could not be higher. But I know we can do it<U+0097>together.. If we<U+0092>re going to keep the House, flip the Senate, and win the White House in 100 days, we<U+0092>re going to need all hands on deck. Volunteer with a campaign. Get some friends to register to vote. Every single interaction you make today until Election Day matters.. Today<U+0092>s the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. But many promises of the ADA remain unfulfilled. To have true equality &amp; justice, we must expand economic opportunity for people with disabilities &amp; build an America that is fully accessible &amp; inclusive for all.. One final crossing over Edmund Pettus Bridge.

An incredibly moving and fitting tribute for John Lewis, a man who carried the baton of justice until the very end. Over the next 100 days, let us pick up that baton and march on to the ballot box in his honor. https://t.co/mewzRp2uTz. In 100 days we have the chance to elect a president who can reassure a nation weary of tweets, lies, and incompetence.

Legendary entertainer and television host Regis Philbin brought laughter and joy to households across our country. My thoughts are with his family and friends during this time. 
https://t.co/rnv5uzczJ7. The federal eviction moratorium has expired. Millions of Americans are now at risk of losing the roof over their head. My heart aches for all those facing uncertainty right now. Congress must move immediately to protect renters. Let<U+0092>s start with my RELIEF Act to stop evictions.. Emmett Till should have turned 79 today. But he was just 14 years old when he was brutally murdered. 

Racism is still alive and well today yet just last month one Republican Senator blocked our bill to make lynching a federal crime. We still have a long way to go as a nation.. Yesterday the U.S. surpassed 4M coronavirus cases.

There's still no adequate national testing strategy.
There's still no adequate national contact tracing strategy. 
There's still no adequate national PPE strategy.

Trump can<U+0092>t absolve himself of responsibility<U+0097>this is on him.. Incredible news. Thank you @KingJames for your leadership and work to reduce the barriers formerly incarcerated individuals face at the ballot box. 
https://t.co/O4xKy6blbi. The federal evictions moratorium and the additional $600 in expanded unemployment benefits are ending this week.

But we already have solutions: my RELIEF Act to protect renters and my bill with @BernieSanders and @EdMarkey to give $2,000 monthly payments throughout the pandemic.. .@JoeBiden doesn<U+0092>t just say we can be a better country<U+0097>he has plans to make it happen, including investing in affordable child care, taking care of our seniors, and improving benefits for working people. All of that is at stake in November.
https://t.co/l0RCtHORQl. The federal minimum wage:

July 24, 2009: $7.25/hour
July 24, 2020: $7.25/hour

It has been 11 years since Americans were last given a raise. We need a $15 minimum wage to be the national floor<U+0097>now.. There are not two sides to the looming eviction crisis: we need to ensure people can keep a roof over their head during this pandemic.<U+00A0>

Watch the full Instagram live with<U+00A0>@JulianCastro here:<U+00A0>https://t.co/6AlHh59xBH https://t.co/kt71TafFhL.

These shameful political and frankly dangerous attacks must end now.
https://t.co/oEnyydp0eM. 20 million renters are facing eviction if Congress doesn<U+0092>t act to protect them. We can<U+0092>t let that happen. 

I<U+0092>m chatting with @JulianCastro on Instagram Live today at 6:30pm ET about my bill to help stop evictions during this health and economic crisis.

https://t.co/7zyWAMx5tl. Donald Trump is trying to incite fear and stir up violence ahead of Election Day. This week I called for an immediate hearing on the federal agents that have been sent to Portland to silence protestors. This disturbing violation of Americans<U+0092> civil rights must end.. Could not have had a better time talking about everything from the importance of this election to my high school dance troupe with you, @sarahcpr.

For those that might have missed it, watch the full video here: https://t.co/iPwKEJY7Pg https://t.co/q0U5Y9pLve. Enjoyed tonight's Instagram Live?

Join us at 7pm ET: https://t.co/ywB4vJ4QAl https://t.co/A6CbLRo2dX. At the end of this week the extra $600 in federal weekly unemployment expires in many states. For many families, that money has meant the difference between putting food on the table during a pandemic and skipping meals.

Congress must extend unemployment benefits immediately.. Yesterday Trump said, <U+0093>We<U+0092>ve done much better than most<U+0094> in response to coronavirus. 

Reality tells a different story. 
https://t.co/bICFSiuB3q. Jon @Ossoff has what it takes to fight for working families in the Senate and lead Georgia forward. But we need you to make that happen. Help us end Mitch McConnell<U+0092>s majority in the Senate by chipping in now:
https://t.co/WnTeQaBKYN https://t.co/suJvCu9cbG. Donald Trump has absolved himself of any responsibility when it comes to the coronavirus crisis that has left 142,000 Americans dead<U+0097>yet is willing to make the burden on cities worse by deploying federal agents. https://t.co/SNFZykN7qu. It's been 130 days since Breonna Taylor was murdered by police in her own home. After they shot her, they left her there to die.

Her killers have not been charged and are still roaming free. Keep demanding justice for Breonna and her family.. Trump is trying to incite fear and distract from his repeated coronavirus failures by sending in camouflaged federal agents. He must withdraw these agents from Portland immediately. https://t.co/uSht7xHlr9. Looking forward to joining the second night ever of #TheReidOut with @JoyAnnReid at 7:15pm ET on @MSNBC. We<U+0092>ll be chatting about everything from the protests in Portland to the latest news of the day.. Let<U+0092>s be clear what Trump is doing: he<U+0092>s trying to silence<U+0097>and punish<U+0097>those protesting police brutality and demanding racial justice across our country. Yesterday I joined my colleagues on a bill to block the Trump admin from deploying paramilitary forces against Americans. https://t.co/VGL8BHpraD. Incredible news, @JoeBiden has called for passing our National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights in his #BuildBackBetter plan. This, along with universal preschool and better pay and benefits for caregivers, is the right way to move our nation forward.
https://t.co/hTbbn6NkUk. Caregivers and early childhood educators<U+0097>many of whom are women or people of color<U+0097>are<U+00A0>too often undervalued and underappreciated.<U+00A0>@JoeBiden has a plan to change that. Tune in now.https://t.co/JHLcmHwOIn. Donald Trump is once again trying to weaponize the Census to scare immigrant communities for his own political purposes. 

This is patently unconstitutional and should be immediately challenged in court.
https://t.co/fYu3hjG6I8. Donald Trump votes by mail but doesn<U+0092>t want you to. He<U+0092>s afraid he<U+0092>s going to lose the next election so he<U+0092>s doing everything he can now to suppress the vote and delegitimize the election. 

Don<U+0092>t let him. Make sure you are registered today.. Last week I announced the RELIEF Act to help stop evictions and foreclosures for a year and stop landlords from raising rent.

We are on the verge of an evictions cliff and getting this passed is of the essence to help struggling Americans.. In April, Congress was notified that the United States Postal Service could run out of money by September, mere months before Election Day. @marceelias is right, Congress must step up to support the USPS and take swift action to safeguard our elections.
https://t.co/FoeThc2LAv. .@sarahcpr's brilliant videos have been a bright light for me and so many others during these trying times and I can't wait to go live with her on my Instagram this Wednesday, July 22 at 6pm ET. https://t.co/TdqiATJnBQ. .@MikeEspyMS' father's funeral home prepared Emmett Till's body.

https://t.co/tySngMldDX. Racial inequity touches every aspect of life<U+0097>from economic justice to environmental justice. Dismantling the very systems that lead to these injustices won<U+0092>t be easy, but it is possible. Standing in solidarity with the #StrikeForBlackLives today.. If Trump and Republicans succeed, this would be a gut-punch for unemployed Americans. 

A payroll tax cut doesn<U+0092>t help those who aren<U+0092>t on a payroll, and slashed unemployment benefits won<U+0092>t help people get back on their feet. This should be a nonstarter. 
https://t.co/rYd9olZ5us. To honor John Lewis<U+0092> life and legacy, I<U+0092>m calling on Mitch McConnell to immediately bring the Voting Rights Advancement Act to the Senate floor for a vote and the Senate should name it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020.. The pandemic has created a looming eviction crisis that could leave millions of renters without a roof over their head. Passing my RELIEF Act is one step to ensuring that doesn<U+0092>t happen. https://t.co/968OsKzchl.

It<U+0092>s here. It<U+0092>s real. And unless Republicans grow a spine and stand up to this dangerous decision more Americans will die. 
https://t.co/CjCIW4XR5a. Remembering John Lewis' pivotal speech from the March on Washington. He was only 23 then.
https://t.co/XM0QtMjbaI. If Mitch McConnell really wanted to really honor the life, legacy, and activism of John Lewis he'd bring the Voting Rights Act immediately to the Senate floor for a vote and name it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020. https://t.co/LNrYozFN1I. John Lewis once said, ""You cannot be afraid to speak up and speak out for what you believe. You have to have courage, raw courage."" In his memory, let's continue to speak out against injustice and have the courage to make #GoodTrouble.. The world is dimmer this morning without Congressman John Lewis in it.

He carried the baton of justice until the very end. It<U+0092>s now on us to pick it up and march on. https://t.co/aiRfh7RsfF. John Lewis was an icon who fought with every ounce of his being to advance the cause of civil rights for all Americans. I'm devastated for his family, friends, staff<U+0097>and all those whose lives he touched.

My friend, thank you for showing the world what #GoodTrouble looks like. https://t.co/cvG8nSJCW5. With unemployment skyrocketing &amp; so many Americans struggling to make ends meet, our country is facing an eviction &amp; homelessness crisis like never before. Yesterday I announced the RELIEF Act to stop evictions &amp; rent increases for a year to get people through this pandemic.. Six years ago today Eric Garner<U+0092>s last words, <U+0093>I can<U+0092>t breathe,<U+0094> reverberated across our nation. 

Six years later, we<U+0092>re still fighting for accountability and consequence for police brutality<U+0097>and a national ban on chokeholds. https://t.co/hQUIurxtB3. They left her there to die. 

Breonna Taylor deserved better and I will not rest calling for justice until all the officers involved in her murder are charged. https://t.co/scHpNiyyn1. Republicans didn<U+0092>t bat an eye at Trump<U+0092>s tax scam for the top 1% and the wealthiest corporations but are balking at giving working people the help they need to get through this crisis. It<U+0092>s pure hypocrisy. https://t.co/jlLnf3gSMt. This is right out of the authoritarian playbook. Americans have rights and they cannot be disregarded by unidentified uniformed agents. We need answers. Now.
https://t.co/JlADJ2JwlI. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been a fighter her whole life and I know this next challenge is no different. Joining those across our nation sending love and prayers. 
https://t.co/96XAnTvpv2. Five months ago when asked about coronavirus Trump said, <U+0093>We have it totally under control.<U+0094> Yesterday we passed a grim milestone with over 77,000 cases in a day.

This was avoidable. 
https://t.co/vCXLm4BaqP. We lost a giant today. Civil rights champion Reverend C.T. Vivian dedicated his life to<U+00A0>fighting and organizing against racial justice and to make our nation<U+00A0>a better place for all. Keeping his family in my prayers during this time. https://t.co/SSfnIQWnCE. Millions of Americans are on the verge of eviction in the midst of a global pandemic. We can't let that happen. 

Today I announced the RELIEF Act to stop evictions, rent increases, and utility shutoffs throughout this crisis. https://t.co/M7kTkkJoT0. While Trump is too busy blaming other people for his failures, Americans across our country are facing financial hardships. Joining @chrislhayes on @MSNBC at 8pm ET tonight to discuss my new bill that Congress must pass to help renters during this crisis.. Today I announced the RELIEF Act, a bill to ban evictions and foreclosures for renters and homeowners for a year<U+0097>and prohibit landlords from raising the rent during this health and economic crisis. 

Housing is a human right. It<U+0092>s time we treated it like one.. .@DougJones is in a tight race and it's imperative we hold on to his seat in the Senate. Donate now to make sure he has the resources he needs to win reelection and help us move our nation forward: https://t.co/mPbsFFUEdX https://t.co/NdhK6MHNVO. Today I introduced the RELIEF Act. It will:
<U+2705>Ban evictions &amp; foreclosures for renters &amp; homeowners for a year
<U+2705>Prohibit landlords from raising rent
<U+2705>Ban utility shutoffs
<U+2705>Prevent negative credit reporting on evictions
https://t.co/dpxJVHayz0. Last month my colleagues and I called for an immediate review of the use of rubber bullets by police. No one should ever suffer permanent blindness or other horrific injuries because they were peacefully protesting. 
https://t.co/99iF3JmCJi. It<U+0092>s time for change in Maine. Yesterday, @SaraGideon won her primary and now it<U+0092>s up to us to help her flip that Senate seat from red to blue. Can you chip in $15 now to ensure victory?
https://t.co/l1eIiUmRkv. To say this is alarming is an understatement. Trump has tried to minimize this crisis from the very beginning. He repeatedly said he wishes there were fewer cases. Americans deserve to know critical coronavirus data is free from political interference. 
https://t.co/9FVnJusnvo. Today at 2:30pm ET I<U+0092>m joining St. Paul Mayor @melvincarter3 for a virtual roundtable to discuss @JoeBiden<U+0092>s #BuildBackBetter plan to repair our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of clean energy jobs. RSVP now. 
https://t.co/WR8IcldcOE. @candacefor24 Congratulations @candacefor24 on your victory last night! I know you<U+0092>ll be a strong advocate for progressive change in Texas. Onward to November.. Black folks aren<U+0092>t receiving the same kind of treatment that others receive in our health care system<U+0097>and for some it has life or death consequences.  

Today I announced a new bill to address that inequality and provide patients of color with equal care.
https://t.co/3uX0zvtfCc. An absolutely stunning and powerful cover of @violadavis by Dario Calmese<U+0097>the first Black photographer to shoot a @VanityFair cover. https://t.co/R2qRLpePm0. Thank you, @rweingarten and @AFTunion, for having me today to discuss how we can hold police accountable and keep our students safe in schools. Grateful to have the opportunity to speak with leaders who fight for the best of who we are day in and day out. https://t.co/kEl5SN4lbD. It has been four months. Four months without any justice for Breonna Taylor's friends and family. 

The police who murdered her in her own home still have not been charged. 

Do not forget about her.. This despicable and cruel rule should<U+0092>ve never been proposed in the first place. Thanks to everyone who raised their voice and fought back. Because of you, international students can stay. https://t.co/uorDfd4xpz. Heartbreaking. When planning the best course of action for schools in the fall, decision makers must also prioritize the safety of our teachers and staff.
https://t.co/eMC6PAZ0pp. Tune in now to hear @JoeBiden<U+0092>s latest plan to build back a better economy and a better America for working families.<U+00A0>
https://t.co/8CrJpn5Vzh. Today is Runoff Tuesday and Primary Day in Alabama, Maine, and Texas. Your vote is your voice. Be sure to turn in your absentee ballot and if you decide to head to the polls, be sure to wear a mask, maintain social distancing, and wash your hands.. If we take back the Senate and elect @JoeBiden president, we can address police brutality. Keep our communities safe from gun violence. Act to combat the climate crisis.

But none of this will be possible if we don<U+0092>t flip the Senate and remove Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader.. As we<U+0092>ve seen with the Black maternal health crisis, every day we don<U+0092>t confront the persistent disparities in our health care system could mean the difference between life and death for someone. 

No one should ever go to the doctor and not have their pain taken seriously. https://t.co/Rf50Ujd7Lo. It<U+0092>s been 122 days since Breonna Taylor was murdered in her own home. The officers who killed her are still walking free. I will never stop demanding justice for her family and loved ones.. There are more than 35M people living with a disability who are eligible to vote. But too often voting is inaccessible. This National Disability Voter Registration Week, I<U+0092>m calling on Congress to pass my VoteSafe Act to make voting in the age of coronavirus accessible for all.. Evictions may soon leave ~28M homeless in the United States. We are on the verge of a wave of evictions if Congress doesn<U+0092>t swiftly act to ban evictions and foreclosures during the pandemic<U+0097>and pass my bill to provide $2,000 monthly payments. Time is of the essence.. Trump is more concerned about TV ratings and muzzling public health experts in the middle of a pandemic than the health and well-being of the American people. 
https://t.co/einuzgCf9E. There are two systems of justice in America: one for Trump and his cronies<U+0097>and one for everybody else. It<U+0092>s not right and people are sick and tired of it. In November, let<U+0092>s end this national nightmare.. Do not let Republicans and this administration ever make you feel like you are alone. You are not alone. Together we will fight for what<U+0092>s right. https://t.co/NeuaXUV38r. International students are a vital part of our communities and schools. It<U+0092>s outrageous they are being threatened with deportation in the midst of a public health crisis. @DianneFeinstein and I are calling on @ICEgov to withdraw this despicable proposal immediately.. The presidency isn't the only thing at stake this November. Across the country, #DemGovs have been fighting Trump<U+0092>s disastrous agenda at every turn. 

@DemGovs have the chance to deliver historic victories in key battleground states. Can you chip in now? https://t.co/WQMTaw91hS. Betsy DeVos<U+0092> lack of leadership on how to safely resume schools is dangerous to our students, our teachers, and our staff. 

She has no plan.
https://t.co/si1J1Uka4o. Donald Trump has been sowing hate and division for almost four years. We need a president who will lift up the condition and the spirit of the American people, bringing dignity back to the Oval Office. @JoeBiden will do that. https://t.co/XArldmZcIE. From abject denial to muzzling public health experts, it was clear there was never a plan. 
https://t.co/KeQkdKtYzD. It<U+0092>s deeply unsettling that Facebook has the resources to vigorously combat voter suppression and protect civil rights<U+0097>yet hasn<U+0092>t acted.
https://t.co/pN0SEVbGN1. I<U+0092>m glad Virginia is leading to help survivors get the justice they deserve. As California<U+0092>s Attorney General, I made clearing the rape kit backlog at state-run labs a top priority<U+0097>and we got it done within my first year. It<U+0092>s time our nation did the same.
https://t.co/PcF3ncBKIv. From slavery, Jim Crow laws, and policing, America<U+0092>s history has been defined by two systems of justice. And the result is that Black Americans have been treated as less than human. Passing the Justice in Policing Act is one step to making our justice system more fair for all.. Every American deserves the right to clean, affordable water. Thank you @NAACP_LDF for taking on this crucial fight that has disproportionately affected Detroit's Black &amp; low-income residents. Congress must pass my Water Justice Act to help ensure affordable water for all. https://t.co/T8VU3UqLMo. Breonna Taylor.
George Floyd.
Elijah McClain.
Atatiana Jefferson.
Tamir Rice.

For them, and countless others, there are two systems of justice in America.. Trump commutes the prison sentence of Roger Stone while the officers that killed Breonna Taylor are still free. The two systems of justice in this country must end.. A majority of our teachers already pay for school supplies with their own money. Are they also going to have to pay out of their own pocket for PPE and other necessities to keep themselves and their students safe? https://t.co/0dPTvIq5bi. People are suffering. Small businesses have closed for good. People<U+0092>s bills are piling up and they have no job to pay them. Parents are juggling teaching their kids and keeping food on the table.

We can help. Let's pass our small business bill and implement recurring payments.. .@HowardU was one of the places that helped shape who I am today. It<U+0092>s about more than an education<U+0097>Howard instilled in generations of students a purpose and passion to change the world. @MakurMaker, welcome to the Bison family.
https://t.co/0InUXXTNN5. @JoaquinCastrotx @JoaquinCastrotx and @JulianCastro<U+0097>sending you, your family, and the entire Castro team our love during this difficult time.. Donald Trump likes to use the term 'commander in chief' but he's in command of nothing except his own ego. https://t.co/rO3aX0IbL2. A big thank you to everyone who joined us for #GetUpStandUp2020 tonight in support of @JoeBiden. I hope you enjoyed dancing and singing along as much as I did!

Just 10 more minutes until #GetUpStandUp2020! Drop your photos below from your at-home party or videos of your best dance moves during the event and I<U+0092>ll retweet some of my favorites.. Today<U+0092>s Supreme Court decision holding the federal government to its word and honoring its treaties with Creek Nation was both the right one and an important one. Honoring the sovereignty of Tribal governments means living up to those obligations.. It<U+0092>s not too late to get your tickets for tonight<U+0092>s #GetUpStandUp2020<U+0097>a virtual dance party in support of @JoeBiden! Tickets starting at $25: https://t.co/SIVB1NQ7r3 https://t.co/8BrIdTgQGU. For far too long our essential care workers<U+0097>who are predominantly women and people of color<U+0097>have been underpaid and underappreciated. No more. Under @JoeBiden's #BuildBackBetter plan higher pay, improved benefits, and opportunities will be prioritized.
https://t.co/OBEeMfukmq. We are at an inflection point in the history of our nation. @JoeBiden knows the strength of our union is in our diversity and what we need to do to build a better America. Watch now.
https://t.co/8cD4jRFKMc. Twenty times. Twenty times George Floyd pleaded that he couldn<U+0092>t breathe. It<U+0092>s horrific. All of the officers involved must be held accountable.
https://t.co/ZtGTYlm39q. Congratulations, @JoyAnnReid! A barrier-breaking moment for Black women in prime time. You did that. Well-earned.
https://t.co/k6BSBTiSzw. Today<U+0092>s the day! Who<U+0092>s ready for a night of dancing and conversation at #GetUpStandUp2020 with our nation<U+0092>s top DJs? There is still time to get your tickets before the event at 7pm ET tonight. Buy now: https://t.co/SIVB1NQ7r3 https://t.co/0gPNPx3sVK. African Americans and Latinos are 3x as likely to get coronavirus<U+0097>and 2x more likely to die<U+0097>than white people.

This admin tried to hide the disproportionate impact coronavirus has on our communities. This is exactly why I called for a racial disparities task force months ago.. Congratulations @OSUPrezDrake on your historic new role. Our students are in good hands. 
https://t.co/rxAG36euG6. At a coronavirus testing site in New Orleans, tests ran out 5 minutes after the doors opened. In Phoenix, people waited in their cars up to 8 hours to get tested. It<U+0092>s outrageous that in July we still don<U+0092>t have enough tests for everyone who needs it. 
https://t.co/tVWmXvJL9p. Our nation has a water safety, affordability, and sustainability crisis. Unless we take bold action, the climate crisis will continue to intensify water scarcity. Last week I introduced the Water for Tomorrow Act to help ensure a future with safe, clean, affordable water for all.. One of the most important things we can be doing right now is registering people to vote. It's all on the line in November. https://t.co/FnG1NKpb0G. TOMORROW: Get ready for a fun-filled night with @BEVERLYBOND, @diplo, @DJCassidy, @djdnice, @HannahBronfman, and @jermainedupri<U+0097>all in support of our next president @JoeBiden. Tickets starting at $25: https://t.co/OGEqZK8P4Q. Tune in now as I join @VotoLatino President @MariaTeresa1 to discuss what we need to do to ensure our voices are heard in November. 
https://t.co/jnjPN18B15. An incredibly moving and powerful message of hope for our future from @AdyBarkan. Our fight for progress is stronger with him by our side.
https://t.co/dlT022zz42. A shameful decision by the Supreme Court that will deny up to 126,000 employees birth control coverage. https://t.co/q3Hcarm8UQ. We need to follow the guidance of our health experts and ensure our children and teachers aren<U+0092>t put into dangerous situations.
https://t.co/GvTzycM5zT. LIVE TOMORROW: Join me and @VotoLatino President @MariaTeresa1 at 3pm ET as we discuss the urgency of this year's election and how we can ensure everyone raises their voice at the ballot box. https://t.co/1hUPHoo1wL. We are months into a global pandemic that has left millions unemployed and people scraping together to pay their rent. We can't leave people behind during this crisis. That's why I introduced a bill with @BernieSanders and @EdMarkey to give people $2,000 monthly payments.. There may not be a drumline at #GetUpStandUp2020, but there will be dancing. Only two more days to get your tickets for our virtual dance party with some of our nation<U+0092>s top DJs<U+0097>all to support @JoeBiden. Join us here: https://t.co/BUJSCVttrv https://t.co/vkZ2LZaDLt. Trump officially withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization in the middle of a global health crisis. 

This move is reckless, short-sighted, and surrenders what was left of America's leadership on the world stage.. My message to Dreamers: no matter what this week brings, I have your back. We will never stop fighting for you.. Horrific. We must not turn a blind eye to the dark, despicable part of our nation's history that is still alive and well today. 
https://t.co/wKYKvM99Zx. This despicable and needlessly cruel decision upends the lives of our international students and further tarnishes America<U+0092>s reputation and competitiveness. It's shameful how low this administration will go to distract from Trump<U+0092>s failed pandemic response. https://t.co/b9GHRwPzEk. The Affordable Care Act is benefitting millions of Americans, and its destruction would have a devastating impact on low-income communities, people with preexisting conditions, seniors, and people of color. 

Yet Trump is actively trying to dismantle the ACA during a pandemic.. After years of Tribal and Native communities &amp; activists fighting against this injustice, today is a huge victory. Together let's keep up the fight to uphold Tribal treaty rights, protect the water we drink &amp; leave our children a more sustainable future.
https://t.co/nJ4tPj1xEy. @KeishaBottoms Keeping you, your husband, and your entire family in my prayers for a swift and easy recovery. Take care.. An Asian-American man was attacked in a hardware store, with the perpetrator yelling he was ""bringing that Chinese virus over here.<U+0094>

Trump<U+0092>s repeated racist rhetoric continues to put the lives of Asian Americans and Asian immigrants at risk. 
https://t.co/eCghBlMazH. Meanwhile, 440,000 Black-owned small businesses are expected to close<U+0097>think of how many this could have helped.
https://t.co/LYC50oqEH6. Elijah McClain was killed in August.

He was picking up an iced tea for his brother.

Not one officer has been arrested for his death. We need #JusticeForElijahMcClain.. Horrifying. No doctor should ever be forced to decide who lives and who dies. Wear a mask<U+0097>not just to protect yourself but the people around you.
https://t.co/ZzY5vgiu6u. We saw how far our adversaries will go to influence our elections. My colleagues and I introduced a bipartisan amendment to ensure transparency for foreign media.
https://t.co/GfiWn0FwH5. There is still time to get your tickets to #GetUpStandUp2020! Join some of our nation<U+0092>s top DJs for a dance party and conversation in support of @JoeBiden! Don<U+0092>t miss out: https://t.co/84jkOoFqHG https://t.co/65YsJutKeP. Absolutely heartbreaking. Summer Taylor was only 24-years-old, peacefully protesting for Black Lives Matter when they were struck by a car. Thinking of their family during this difficult time and everyone in the movement today. https://t.co/i7hqkjSSMH. The future of our country relies on everyone raising their voice and casting their ballot in November. Register to vote now at https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt.. The speech Thurgood Marshall gave twenty-eight years ago still resonates to this day: <U+0093>Democracy just cannot flourish amid fear. Liberty cannot bloom amid hate. Justice cannot take root amid rage. America must get to work.<U+0094>. This Independence Day, I<U+0092>m grateful for our brave service members and those who fight every day for our country<U+0092>s values. Fueled by love and optimism in what we can be, I know we can create a more just and better nation for all.. We cannot overlook the toll this pandemic and existing racial disparities have had on our Black children<U+0097>and how it could subsequently impact their future. 
https://t.co/saQZWMmbm9. We cannot allow giant gig corporations to exempt themselves from providing essential protections and benefits for their workers. I urge Californians to join me in standing with these essential workers by voting NO on Prop 22.. Trump attempted to muzzle public health experts. Repeatedly said coronavirus was ""under control."" Refused for a long time to wear a mask to ensure people took this threat seriously.

At a time when Americans are depending on competent leadership, Trump has failed again and again.. No Black girl should ever grow up thinking she's less than because of her hair. This #CROWNDay, let's embrace our natural hair and fight to pass the Crown Act to make it illegal to discriminate against hair texture and styles.. Coronavirus doesn<U+0092>t take holidays off. This weekend please wear a mask, maintain social distancing, and wash your hands. It can save your life, the lives of the people you love, and complete strangers.. Our Justice in Policing Act will:
<U+2192>Expand independent investigations into police misconduct 
<U+2192>Establish a national police misconduct registry
<U+2192>Require states to report use of force incidents
<U+2192>Set a national standard for use of force
<U+2192>Ban no-knock warrants in drug cases. What<U+0092>s happening in ICE detention facilities is utterly shameful. DHS must immediately prioritize the release of low-risk and vulnerable people.
https://t.co/nm0yScnUPw. 1 in 1,500 Black Americans has died from coronavirus.

This pandemic is further reinforcing historic inequities we<U+0092>ve had in our nation long before we ever heard the word <U+0093>coronavirus.<U+0094> Confronting these disparities must be at the forefront.. My childhood hero and inspiration, Thurgood Marshall, was born on this day in 1908. Our nation is stronger because of his powerful voice for civil rights and social justice. 
https://t.co/mPvcEOn6S9. So Republicans will bail out large corporations but not help hurting Americans trying to make ends meet during a global pandemic? It<U+0092>s completely callous. 
https://t.co/PtreSBANf8. The United States just hit 50,000 new coronavirus cases in a day yesterday<U+0097>and we were warned we could see 100,000 per day.

Instead of taking meaningful action to reduce cases, Trump is waving the white flag.
https://t.co/ON6wzSIt6n. Black communities have historically been undercounted in the Census. We can<U+0092>t let that happen again. @myBlackCounts is helping to ensure the funding we need for a brighter future, such as our public schools and college financial aid programs. Learn more at https://t.co/TVfkJOtUoL. This is absurd. No one in our country should have to jump through loopholes in order to get their coronavirus tests and treatment covered. It needs to be free.
https://t.co/o1LdtYjv7H. Join me and our nation's top DJs for #GetUpStandUp2020<U+0097>a virtual dance party in support of @JoeBiden. Get your tickets now: https://t.co/kAv9jjm2hl https://t.co/O6a4ZNcSMz. Tune in to @DeadlineWH on @MSNBC at 4pm ET. I'll be on with @NicolleDWallace to discuss the latest reports regarding Russia and why we cannot settle for an inadequate middle ground when it comes to holding police accountable for misconduct.. Coronavirus has killed nearly 130,000 Americans.
We were warned the U.S. could see 100,000 new cases a day. 
Yet there is still no adequate national testing strategy.

It could not be more clear: Trump has surrendered to this virus and abandoned Americans.. Joining @CapehartJ tomorrow at 3:30pm ET to chat about what we<U+0092>re doing in Congress to address police brutality and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Sign up now: https://t.co/wHdxhTLMYD https://t.co/v4fYJd4tFE. Rent is due today and countless Americans don<U+0092>t know how they<U+0092>re going to make ends meet this month. 

A one-time payment wasn<U+0092>t nearly enough. We can<U+0092>t wait any longer to pass my bill to provide $2,000 every month throughout this pandemic.. After 109 days and no justice, I say Breonna Taylor<U+0092>s name. I say the names of Sandra Bland, Atatiana Jefferson, Aiyana Jones, and the countless others who were killed by police or who died in police custody. We will continue to demand change in their honor.. When it comes to voting during the pandemic, it<U+0092>s critical that any solutions we come up with protect Native Americans<U+0092> access to the ballot box. My VoteSafe Act would do just that.
https://t.co/5LX9FJyMXy. 45 million Americans lost their jobs.
U.S. billionaires gained $584 billion. 

This pandemic is highlighting why income inequality is one of the most pressing issues of our time. 
https://t.co/h8rQoIxUXK. This pandemic called for national leadership<U+0097>and Trump failed. Tune in now to hear<U+00A0>@JoeBiden's response to this global crisis and how his administration would have taken action.<U+00A0>
https://t.co/jcZeBycNtS. <U+0093>I can<U+0092>t breathe<U+0094> has been repeated over and over again by George Floyd, Eric Garner, Derrick Scott, and so many more whose names never made headlines. 

The Justice in Policing Act would ban chokeholds and hold police who use them accountable.
https://t.co/ZgvntxLTLg. Because no-knock warrants in drug cases were legal in Louisville, officers were able to burst into Breonna Taylor<U+0092>s home without warning.

They murdered her.

Our Justice in Policing Act would ban no-knock warrants in drug cases. The Senate must pass it now.. These are not faceless numbers<U+0097>they were real people with families, friends, and a community mourning their loss. 

We are still in a pandemic. It hasn<U+0092>t gone away. Please continue to wear a mask and maintain social distancing.
https://t.co/zwQnFFkZVt. Powerful speech from @Beyonce at last night<U+0092>s #BETAwards, <U+0093>There are people banking on us staying at home during the local elections and primaries happening in states across the country. We have to vote like our life depends on it, because it does.<U+0094>
https://t.co/dxNGl8B2UN. As CA's Attorney General, I was proud to be 1 of 13 Attorneys General to file a brief on Whole Woman's Health, urging the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court's decision that undermined abortion access. I fought then &amp; will never stop fighting to defend our reproductive care.. A huge victory for reproductive rights. Abortion is a fundamental issue of justice in America and we will never stop fighting for it. https://t.co/UggEeWp9Ys. Excited to announce <U+0091>Get Up, Stand Up<U+0092> <U+0097> a dance party and conversation with our nation<U+0092>s top DJs <U+0097> all to support @JoeBiden. Be among the first to get your tickets:
https://t.co/ihvzemhrwe https://t.co/XEblUc3pK6. 51 years ago at Stonewall, brave LBGTQ+ New Yorkers<U+0097>led by transgender women of color<U+0097>galvanized a movement. To honor their legacy, we must continue to speak out against transphobia and homophobia in our nation. We cannot relent. Work still remains to ensure equal rights for all.. On this day in 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act. It has been under attack ever since. 

Just this week Trump<U+0092>s lawyers filed a brief trying to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act and strip 20 million Americans of their health care<U+0097>in a pandemic.. Absolutely heartbreaking. 

Our communities are suffering because of this administration<U+0092>s lack of leadership.
https://t.co/ee6M2BNGaY. Seven years ago today wedding bells rang out as same-sex marriages became legal in California<U+0097>two years before it was nationwide. It was a day I will never forget, filled with pure joy and an abundance of love.
https://t.co/zflNQAVWqO. An important read. Coronavirus doesn<U+0092>t just affect the elderly or those with underlying conditions. Everyone needs to take this virus seriously. 
https://t.co/hPhiPCU543. There still have been no charges in Breonna Taylor<U+0092>s murder. It<U+0092>s been 106 days. We cannot relent in our fight for justice.. The <U+0093>gay/trans panic<U+0094> defense has been used to justify horrific acts of violence against the LGBTQ+ community. As San Francisco<U+0092>s DA and California<U+0092>s AG, I helped make ours the first state to ban it. This #PrideMonth, let<U+0092>s commit to banning this reprehensible defense nationwide.. @DrBiden Thank you, Dr. Biden, for having me. We will not stop fighting to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act.. Devin was about to get married. Rose loved to laugh and dance with her grandchildren. Zlatko had survived the September 11 attacks. 

These are just a few of the more than 122,000 lives we have lost to coronavirus. My heart aches for their families. 
https://t.co/zdghL40kpE. Congratulations, Alexis! As attempts to restrict critical health and reproductive care continue, I<U+0092>m grateful for your leadership. Proud to be a partner in the fights ahead. https://t.co/g0oueWwdwr. If someone<U+0092>s knee is on your neck, you cannot take it halfway off and call it progress.

Read my op-ed with @CoryBooker on our Justice in Policing Act and why we cannot settle for an inadequate middle ground when it comes to addressing police brutality.
https://t.co/t6kaNUHYbU. Mary Jackson<U+0092>s groundbreaking accomplishments helped us win the space race and paved the way for Black women across our country. Grateful she<U+0092>s being honored in this way. 
https://t.co/xJt5o0iQ8x. We have to ban chokeholds. No more excuses. No more delays. 

Add your name now to join me and @JoeBiden in demanding Congress swiftly ban chokeholds and pass meaningful police reform: https://t.co/zSSyAS1OpU. Washington, D.C. has 700,000+ residents<U+0097>more than some states<U+0097>but they are denied full representation in Congress. 

It<U+0092>s time to grant D.C. statehood.. Late last night<U+0097>in the middle of a pandemic<U+0097>the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to end the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions. We can<U+0092>t let that happen. Join me and @DrBiden today to discuss protecting the ACA: https://t.co/nv1qXOUsf6 https://t.co/DpCoQ4obEm. Five years ago today, the highest court in the land affirmed that every American can marry the person they love. We will never give up fighting for equality for the LGBTQ+ community. #LoveIsLove. <U+0093>Apathy to cruelty is the failure to see our own humanity reflected in the pain of others.<U+0094>

Ryan, thank you so much for sharing about your brother Dhruvanand <U+0093>Ravi<U+0094> Budhu. We all have a duty to break the silence on systemic racism.
https://t.co/Kp4FH8w690. 20M more Americans have health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act.
135M people with pre-existing conditions are now protected.
12M seniors now pay lower prescription drug costs.

Yet Trump continued today to advance his lawsuit to repeal the ACA. During a pandemic.. TUNE IN: Tonight at 10pm ET I'll be on @BravoWWHL to chat about the movement happening across our nation and much more! https://t.co/tRoR7CjGiB. It<U+0092>s been 104 days since the Louisville Police Department SWAT team burst into Breonna Taylor<U+0092>s home and murdered her. She worked to save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic<U+0097>it is time for us to honor hers by demanding justice.
https://t.co/MuLZFu7f5v. @VoteJackie4NY Congratulations @VoteJackie4NY! Just as you<U+0092>ve served your country and your community, I know you<U+0092>ll be a powerful advocate for Long Island in Congress. Let<U+0092>s flip #NY02.. Absolutely crushing. Elijah McClain was just picking up an iced tea for his brother, trying to get home. Keep up the calls for justice and accountability for his family.
https://t.co/GDTKSzNtHV. The Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act seven years ago today. Mitch McConnell is currently blocking legislation to restore it. This shouldn<U+0092>t be a partisan issue.. Trump<U+0092>s unchecked racist and xenophobic rhetoric against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants directly puts their lives at risk. It<U+0092>s dangerous. There is no excuse for this. 
https://t.co/QUnWlGudMH. Everyone should be held accountable when they break the rules and break the law<U+0097>and that includes police officers. https://t.co/x7lLum1zir. Finally. They hunted down Ahmaud Arbery, fatally shot him in broad daylight, and filmed it. Ahmaud<U+0092>s family deserves justice. https://t.co/nqJo04qnOW. Just because you get rid of testing doesn't mean coronavirus is gone. Cases are still spiking. 

Trump has abandoned the American people. https://t.co/orokFQqm6j. It couldn<U+0092>t be more clear that the Republicans<U+0092> attempt to pass their watered-down policing bill is meant to derail meaningful reform. 

Who do you trust on police reform<U+0097>Mitch McConnell or the 138 civil rights groups who oppose the Republican bill?. @DrCameronWebb Congratulations, @DrCameronWebb on your historic victory last night! #VA05 will be lucky to have you fighting for them in Congress. Onward to November.. The injustices endured by generations of Black Americans affect us all. Thankful the Justice in Policing Act has the support of so many inspiring entertainers like @rihanna, @MeekMill, @maryjblige, and @ArianaGrande.
https://t.co/YBvS47iXUR. The Republican policing bill doesn<U+0092>t ban harmful policing practices, such as racial and religious profiling or no-knock warrants in drug cases. Joining @MSNBC at 10:45am ET this morning to discuss this and more.. Justice is on the ballot. Register for @CollectivePAC<U+0092>s virtual speaker series tomorrow where we<U+0092>ll discuss disparities in our broken criminal justice system and how we can change the system for the better.
https://t.co/cE6EMGAzaG. I will be voting against the motion to proceed tomorrow on the Republican policing bill. It doesn't give justice to the people of this movement and it doesn<U+0092>t give justice to the lives lost.

We should proceed<U+0097>but with real action, not lip-service.. Republicans introduced a watered-down policing bill, intent on obstructing meaningful change. It doesn't even begin to address the longstanding discrimination and abuses that have existed in the system.

Talking about this and more tonight at 8:30pm ET on @AC360 on @CNN.. People are marching in the streets because they rightly believe there are two systems of justice in America. They<U+0092>re sick and tired of watching Black people murdered with little to no consequence. Passing the Justice in Policing Act would ensure officers are held accountable.. Looking forward to joining @lesbiantech for #PrideSummit at 6pm ET today. There<U+0092>s a stellar lineup of speakers, so be sure to RSVP now: https://t.co/BwZZtwYPYg https://t.co/ww5Pxevvgw. Today is Primary Day in Kentucky, New York, and Virginia<U+0097>and your voice matters. If you have an absentee ballot, make sure it<U+0092>s turned in. And if you decide to head to the polls, please be sure to wear a mask and maintain social distancing when possible.. Pundits ask whether Democrats are serious about policing reform. Are you kidding me? 

We responded to the cries in the streets with the Justice in Policing Act. We aren't the ones standing in the way of progress with watered-down policies that wouldn't have saved George Floyd.. It<U+0092>s time to address police brutality by passing the Justice in Policing Act. 
https://t.co/xTHhY3Dt6C. It<U+0092>s critical we get to the bottom of why Trump and his crony Barr wanted former U.S. attorney Berman out so badly. What are they trying to cover up?. In a typical election year, Kentucky has 3,700 polling places. Tuesday<U+0092>s primary will have fewer than 200 polling places.

Congress must pass my VoteSafe Act to ensure no voter has to choose between casting their ballot and their health.
https://t.co/PgqHIBDA89. We<U+0092>re getting closer to reaching our goal. Every single House seat counts in this election and we need @TimsDesiree representing the people of Ohio. Let<U+0092>s go: https://t.co/3ioIoUbkr4 https://t.co/KkLLI9FfiZ. It<U+0092>s been more than 100 days since Breonna Taylor was murdered. The police who killed her still have not been charged. We cannot forget about her in our quest for justice.. I<U+0092>m teaming up with my colleagues @CoryBooker and @SenGillibrand to try to raise $25,000 for @TimsDesiree. For the last seven years #OH10 has been red but I know this is the year we can flip it blue. But we need your help. Can you chip in now? 
https://t.co/YgBNGXLSDQ. The fact that law enforcement is using tear gas on protestors in the middle of a pandemic is outrageous. My colleagues and I are calling for agencies to cease these tacts to prevent the increased risk of coronavirus transmission and unnecessary hospitalizations.. Our nation has a dark and despicable history with Black men hanging from trees. These deaths must be thoroughly investigated. 
https://t.co/WQt2hckTlD. Republicans have been fighting the Affordable Care Act from the moment it became law. And now they<U+0092>re trying to overturn it during a global pandemic. It<U+0092>s utterly heartless. 
https://t.co/kAdwI4m2Qo. Today I<U+0092>m thinking of all the fathers who can<U+0092>t be with their children to celebrate Father<U+0092>s Day. The fathers working an extra shift to help save coronavirus patients. The fathers who are deployed. The fathers in jail simply because they can<U+0092>t afford to make bail.. Happy Father<U+0092>s Day to all the fathers and father-figures across our nation. And to my husband, best friend, and biggest supporter @douglasemhoff<U+0097>you are a wonderful father to Ella and Cole and we<U+0092>re so lucky to have you in our lives. https://t.co/9LWbwcRrSh. Trump perpetuated the birther movement.
Said there were equal people on both sides.
Pushes racist and xenophobic rhetoric to stoke fear.

As Maya Angelou once said, ""When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."". The status quo<U+0092>s not working. We need a system that requires accountability for police officers that break the rules and break the law. 
https://t.co/TeXaRg0euO. Trump<U+0092>s visit to Tulsa opens up the raw wounds of so many descendants of the survivors of the Tulsa massacre.
https://t.co/f8MddhjZ5l. Michael, thank you so much for sharing your story. Because of smartphones, people can no longer turn a blind eye to the injustices our communities have faced for generations. But even if there isn't video, we cannot let those lives taken be forgotten. 
https://t.co/CxoZzDVzUp. Breonna Taylor would still be alive today if there had been a ban on no-knock warrants in drug cases. Our Justice in Policing Act would do just that. https://t.co/E7RSXpOieH. Make no mistake<U+0097>Bill Barr will go down in history as having<U+00A0>aided and abetted the most corrupt president this country has ever seen.. On a day when we celebrate Black liberation, let us be reminded of what Fannie Lou Hamer said: <U+0093>Nobody's free until everybody's free.<U+0094> We still have work to do. #JuneteenthDay. Inequity runs deep in our country. It seeps throughout our education system, affects access to good-paying jobs with a living wage, affordable housing, and so many more issues. 

We must fully reckon with our country<U+0092>s historic and systemic racism to enact change.. A start, but not good enough. We cannot rest until all the officers involved in Breonna Taylor<U+0092>s murder are charged. https://t.co/qKSwAx4dGt. #HappyJuneteenth. Today we recognize the hard-fought road that led to the emancipation of enslaved people and recommit ourselves to America<U+0092>s promise of equal justice for all. Let us never lose hope that change will come.
https://t.co/Qk9yTE0BaO. We have no option but to organize, to mobilize, to turn this moment into a movement.

We won<U+0092>t back down<U+0097>our lives depend on it. Join @unitethepoor<U+0092>s #PoorPeoplesCampaign this Saturday, June 20: 
https://t.co/loE5vn2fCc. There is no excuse.

My VoteSafe Act would provide states with the resources to invest in vote-by-mail, early voting, and ensure no voters have to spend hours upon hours waiting to cast their ballot. https://t.co/hRazpxB4M5. Tonight at 7:15pm I'm joining @JoyAnnReid on @MSNBC to discuss the Supreme Court's DACA decision, Juneteenth, and what Congress can do to make real, meaningful reforms to policing.. The Supreme Court found that white nationalist Stephen Miller<U+0092>s attempt to end DACA was cruel and now illegal. He should resign immediately.. Today the Supreme Court upheld our nation<U+0092>s promise to Dreamers. 

While I will never stop fighting until Dreamers and their families have a path to citizenship, this is some much-needed relief for Dreamers everywhere.. Public school teachers in America consistently have to use their own money to pay for school supplies while we continue to dedicate funding to militarizing the police. 

It<U+0092>s time to ask our local leaders to re-examine our community<U+0092>s priorities and their budgets.. Just because some people and news outlets have moved on from coronavirus doesn<U+0092>t mean the virus is gone. We are still in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has claimed more than 116,000 American lives. 

Wear a mask.. Tonight at 11:35pm ET I'll be back on @colbertlateshow on @CBS to talk about how we can meaningfully address police brutality in our nation and hold officers accountable who break the law. People are marching in the streets, demanding we take real action. We must listen.. He<U+0092>s asked Russia.
He<U+0092>s asked Ukraine. 
He<U+0092>s asked China.

That<U+0092>s not going to stop America from voting for @JoeBiden in November.. Closing the Charleston loophole is common sense. Yet the bill meant to do just that is still sitting on Mitch McConnell<U+0092>s desk.. I kept replaying over and over the final moments of George Floyd<U+0092>s life where he was pleading for his mother. These women did too<U+0097>and it spurred them to run for office.

Five years ago and still more work to do to combat hatred and systemic racism. #EmanuelNine. The Justice in Policing Act would require real accountability and consequence from those in the system who break the rules and break the law. https://t.co/aHhSdqNQZ9. People are not marching in the streets for watered-down proposals that won't hold police officers accountable for misconduct. About to join @ErinBurnett on @CNN at 7:30pm ET to discuss our Justice in Policing Act and how we can make real, meaningful reforms to policing.. Our Justice in Policing Act would:
<U+2705>Set a national standard for use of force
<U+2705>Expand pattern and practice investigations
<U+2705>Increase independent investigations into police misconduct

We can hold police accountable<U+0097>Congress just needs to act.. Trump's policing Executive Order is meaningless. Since day one he's used racially charged rhetoric all while rolling back efforts to root out racism in policing and virtually abandoning police misconduct investigations. We need real reforms. Pass the Justice in Policing Act now.. Democrats only need four seats to flip the Senate and finally remove Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader. Can you split a donation now between four competitive Senate races? Every bit makes a difference.
https://t.co/goQB2kvsDw. No matter what Trump says, we are a stronger nation because of immigrants. 

Farm workers put their blood, sweat &amp; tears to ensure we have food on our tables. We must keep up the fight for better pay &amp; protections for all farm workers and immigrants workers across our country. https://t.co/7zT0cRINym. Women, especially women of color, are bearing the brunt of this economic crisis. Congress must immediately pass my bill to provide $2,000 every month throughout this pandemic. When we lift up the women of our country, our whole society benefits.
https://t.co/cFYfpYrUcW. The Louisville city council passed a law in Breonna Taylor<U+0092>s name to help make sure that what happened to her never happens to anyone else.

Yet the three police officers who murdered Breonna are still roaming free. It<U+0092>s been more than three months.. There's still work to do. The Senate must pass the Equality Act, ensuring the LGBTQ+ community has explicit, comprehensive protection from all forms of discrimination. No one should ever be denied a place to live or service because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.. As @Sunny said, systemic racism touches all levels of our society. It<U+0092>s bad for everyone and it must end. Thank you for speaking this truth.
https://t.co/3I5xJlq7LK. Eight years ago today, DACA was first announced. As a country, we gave Dreamers the opportunity to step out of the shadows with the promise not to deport them. Trump broke that promise. I will never stop fighting until Dreamers and their families have a path to citizenship.. Heart-wrenching. Oluwatoyin Salau used her voice to fight for the Black community and speak out against injustice. She was only 19 and had her whole life ahead of her. 

We must do better to protect Black women and value their lives. #JusticeForToyin https://t.co/WUPb5hpYqT. A major victory for LGBTQ+ rights. No one should be discriminated against because of who they are or who they love. https://t.co/ByvD0z67X3. Our Justice in Policing Act gives the DOJ and state attorneys general more power to investigate entire police departments for patterns and practices of discrimination. No longer should police departments be able to evade accountability and consequence.. Thank your USPS worker, then email your member of Congress and tell them to protect the USPS so we can ensure everyone has access to reliable, affordable mail service.

A moment I will never forget, the day love won in California. #PrideMonth
https://t.co/lmIZr5N5Qq. Black mothers have been crying over their dead children<U+0092>s bodies for generations. But people turned a blind eye. They didn<U+0092>t believe it<U+0097>or didn<U+0092>t want to believe. But now because of smartphones, you can<U+0092>t deny it. You can<U+0092>t turn away. It<U+0092>s there.. Unconscionable. Betsy DeVos has no business serving our students if she can<U+0092>t fight for all students. 
https://t.co/D1i6RU8Kss. More than 112,000 people have died from coronavirus and one in four American workers have lost a job during the pandemic.

Trump was briefed on this threat in January. He had the opportunity to prepare and save lives<U+0097>but he failed to swiftly act.. People will be kicked out of their homes if Congress doesn<U+0092>t quickly move to ban evictions and foreclosures until this pandemic is over<U+0097>and pass my $2,000 monthly payments bill. 

The time to act is now.
https://t.co/hEGDHsH5zT. Robert Fuller's family and the entire Palmdale community deserve answers. There must be further investigation. 
https://t.co/G6kyAKMOyt. The Trump administration is withholding data on who got forgivable loans from the Paycheck Protection Program and for how much. 

The loans were meant for small businesses<U+0097>not large, wealthy corporations. Those who abused the program must be held accountable. We need that data.. This is beautiful. Thankful to my Sorors of @akasorority1908 for providing scholarships to George Floyd<U+0092>s daughter and granddaughters.
https://t.co/aBZ5sGYIW9. A reported 41% of Black-owned small businesses have closed. It<U+0092>s absolutely devastating. 

We must do more to ensure more don<U+0092>t close their doors for good.

I<U+0092>ve introduced the Saving Our Street Act to prioritize getting money to minority-owned small businesses who need it most. https://t.co/2N9gTPKNa7. Civil rights hero Medgar Evers fought to end segregation in Mississippi and secure our right to vote up until his assassination in 1963. Before his death, he said, <U+0093>You can kill a man, but you can<U+0092>t kill an idea.<U+0094>

The pain and the sorrow from that day still runs deep. We must commit to fighting against hate &amp; gun violence in their memory.. I<U+0092>ve been out there with the protesters and it<U+0092>s very clear<U+0097>this is not a moment, but a movement. That gives me hope.. Now is the time to roll up our sleeves and help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. We have the power to make a difference in these races. Can you chip in today? <U+2192> https://t.co/LiLbkj9ku3 https://t.co/XTZ4Hzzak9. It<U+0092>s been 90 days since Breonna Taylor was murdered in her home. The police involved still have not been charged. Keep up the calls for justice.
https://t.co/ZYWxqkxZTg. Roughly 44M Americans have filed for unemployment over the past 12 weeks. 

That<U+0092>s why @BernieSanders, @EdMarkey &amp; I introduced a bill to give $2,000 monthly payments to people throughout this crisis. Bills didn<U+0092>t stop just because we<U+0092>re in the middle of a pandemic. https://t.co/609Rq9DnqE. ""I can't breathe.""<U+00A0>
""I don't care.""

Six words that say so much. Because of cameras, the world is finally seeing in vivid detail the brutality that Black communities have known for generations. Derrick Scott's family deserves justice. https://t.co/cetEZUWQTd. We<U+0092>ve all seen the pictures of horrific injuries peaceful protestors have sustained after being shot with rubber bullets<U+0097>including broken bones, permanent blindness, and deep bruises.

My colleagues and I are calling for an immediate review of the use of rubber bullets by police.. Right now there is no national ban on chokeholds or no-knock warrants in drug cases. The Justice in Policing Act would change that.. Happy one-year anniversary, @ZoraMag! Your work to center and celebrate women of color is so important, especially during this time.

How many more times must our communities be put through the trauma of another Black man or woman killed at the hands of police? Passing our Justice in Policing Act can<U+0092>t wait.. We must ensure what happened in Georgia yesterday does not happen anywhere ever again. Congress must immediately pass my VoteSafe Act to expand vote-by-mail and early voting, and improve safety at polling places. 

Voting is a fundamental right. It must be protected. https://t.co/lBng16dvL3. Right now there<U+0092>s no national registry of officers with a history of misconduct. The Justice in Policing Act would change that.. As state Attorney General, I launched OpenJustice, an initiative that made public data around use of force by police. <U+2063>
<U+2063>
Our Justice in Policing Act would require this data and transparency on a national level. https://t.co/BGiot24hln. African Americans are more than 2X likely to be killed by police. Yesterday @CoryBooker, the Congressional Black Caucus, and I released the first-ever comprehensive police accountability and reform legislation on the federal level to address police misconduct.. Voting machines down.
Limited provisional ballots. 
Hours-long lines. 

#VoterSuppression is happening right now across Georgia, particularly in Black communities. We can't let this happen in November. Congress must immediately pass my VoteSafe Act.. @KimFoxxforSA Thank you, Kim, for your kind words. Your leadership has brought about bold and historic change to the Cook County criminal justice system and I know you will continue to pave the way for generations to come.. As George Floyd is laid to rest next to his mother today, I<U+0092>m holding his family and friends in my heart. His murder sparked a powerful movement and we won<U+0092>t stop fighting for justice for him and his loved ones.. My Justice in Policing Act will: 
<U+2705>Set a national standard for use of force
<U+2705>Expand independent investigations into police misconduct 
<U+2705>Establish a national police misconduct registry
<U+2705>Require states to report use of force incidents
<U+2705>Ban <U+0093>no knock<U+0094> warrants in drug cases.

Add your name now to become a citizen co-sponsor. https://t.co/2Q342pB3BK. I just announced a bill with @CoryBooker and the Congressional Black Caucus to hold police accountable for misconduct. Be the first to hear what the Justice in Policing Act entails live on @TheView at 11:30 a.m. ET.
https://t.co/hDL75Vw15l. The time for change is now. Change in the name of George Floyd. Change in the name of Ahmaud Arbery. Change in the name of Breonna Taylor. And change in the name of the countless other Black Americans who have died at the hands of hatred and racism.. During our campaign, I got to meet Ally. This #PrideMonth, I<U+0092>m thinking of her and the entire LGBTQ+ community. No matter your sexual orientation or color of your skin, we will leave no one to fight alone.
https://t.co/UoqosXSLCm. We cannot let up in the fight for equality, fairness, and justice. Even when<U+0097>if not especially when<U+0097>it is hard or uncomfortable to talk about. Together we can be a force for change.
https://t.co/YnfjI7S7iX.

There are two systems of justice when peaceful protesters are arrested and the police who murdered Breonna Taylor almost three months ago still roam free.. #KHive, I want to take a moment to lift you up for all the support you've given me during these difficult times. Your support does not go unnoticed, so thank you.. A historic moment for New Jersey. Representation matters<U+0097>especially on our courts. 
https://t.co/OKSCb3SgLq. .@ReverendWarnock, thank you for speaking truth to power about our country<U+0092>s dark history of discrimination and racism. 
https://t.co/JySZ9N8mGN. For weeks I've called for: 
<U+2705> a national standard for use of force
<U+2705> pattern/practice investigations into police depts
<U+2705> indept. investigations into police misconduct

Thank you @CoryBooker &amp; CBC for working w/ me on legislation to address systemic racism in the police system.. On the 76th anniversary of #DDay, we remember the heroism of those brave soldiers who defended our freedom on the beaches of Normandy. We are all better because of their courage and sacrifice.. .@TeamJoe, together we can defeat Donald Trump and elect a true leader who will fight for those voices too often ignored.<U+00A0>Onward to November. https://t.co/G3bXNY0qUi. An important step by Governor Newsom. And a big thanks to @DrShirleyWeber and @KevinMcCartyCA for their persistent leadership throughout the years in championing reforms on police accountability, which has made California a model for other states. https://t.co/6EX1oFUOBR. America is raw right now, but it can be healed. It won<U+0092>t happen overnight but if we keep marching and making our voices heard, change will happen. 
https://t.co/yzGnDVDBGK. I believe there is a better future for our country<U+0097>and it starts by working to #TurnTexasBlue. 

And after speaking at the @TexasDemocrats convention today, I believe in their extraordinary power. Chip in $38 now for their 38 electoral votes: https://t.co/65jqcdfuHQ. Hadiya Pendleton was 15-years-old when she was shot and killed in Chicago. Today we #WearOrange to honor her life and all those we<U+0092>ve lost to gun violence. I won<U+0092>t stop fighting until we create a future free from these tragedies.. We cannot forget about Black women in our fight for justice.<U+2063>

Watch the full Instagram Live with @MsPackyetti here: https://t.co/Dmg9wJDaas #SayTheirNames https://t.co/TOT0mRKaug. .@realDonaldTrump, keep George Floyd<U+0092>s name out of your mouth until you can say Black Lives Matter.
https://t.co/YJ6wPw0Hto. I<U+0092>m going live on Instagram at 12:30pm ET with @MsPackyetti to honor #BreonnaTaylor<U+0092>s birthday, lift up local demands, and discuss what systematic changes we can make so no more bright futures are cut short by police. #SayHerName. Today should have been Breonna Taylor<U+0092>s 27th birthday. But her life was horrifically taken by officers who still have not been charged 84 days later. Keep up the calls for justice. #SayHerName. Our government should be there for people during moments of crisis. That<U+0092>s why @BernieSanders, @EdMarkey, and I proposed direct payments of $2,000 a month throughout the course of the pandemic and for three months after. Bills didn<U+0092>t just stop after the first check.. He was reviewed for using force 79 times in three and a half years on the job. This is why we protest. 
https://t.co/Ra3QSbPx45. Last month, I got to chat with Alyssa Jennings, a leader in her community. This question she asked me broke my heart.

Our children are watching us right now. They see what we're doing. We must create a better future for them. https://t.co/OyUunH0SRP. James Scurlock should still be alive today. Thinking of his family as they seek justice. #SayHisName
https://t.co/jKPBcyMDTe. We're fighting for justice for George Floyd. 

We<U+0092>re fighting for those who came before and never got their justice. 
https://t.co/1LRxr3cY0O. My press secretary Tyrone passed away from cancer in 2018 but his family is making sure his legacy lives on in the next generation of leaders.

If you can, give to his scholar program to ensure young Black Americans can get involved &amp; thrive in politics.
https://t.co/ive8C1mZrE. The officers who murdered Breonna Taylor nearly three months ago still have not been charged. We can<U+0092>t forget about Black women in our quest for justice.. TUNE IN: I'll be on @Maddow tonight at 9:30pm ET and @FallonTonight at 11:35pm ET to discuss the latest news in George Floyd's murder and what we can do to confront our nation's history of systemic racism and use of excessive force.. Young Black men and women have always been at the forefront of progress. As<U+00A0>@BarackObama said, ""know that your lives matter, that your dreams matter."" #ObamaTownHall https://t.co/YQEM4fW0Py. For 8 minutes and 46 seconds, George Floyd cried out for his mama and begged to be able to breathe. 

Watch. Listen. Share. This is why we protest.
https://t.co/ANi2etlisg. The people of Ferguson voted for historic change last night. 

Congratulations, @Ella4Ferguson, on your victory. Your leadership in Ferguson will pave the way for a better future for the next generation. 
https://t.co/o7c23i8GEF. It's been 6 years since Tamir Rice. 
4 years since Philando Castile.
1 week since George Floyd.

Until we have serious consequences and accountability for police brutality, these tragedies won't end.. Right now, America is raw.
Her wounds are exposed.

But instead of having a president who understands it, who empathizes and acknowledges the pain, we have someone who chooses to hold up the Bible like a prop for a photo op after tear gassing peaceful protestors.. Let<U+0092>s remember why people are protesting. They are protesting for the Black lives who matter. For the Black lives who were taken from us. https://t.co/baNbwNCLMc. What happened today is extremely troubling. Going to be on @CuomoPrimeTime at 9:20pm ET and @TheLastWord<U+00A0>at 10pm ET to discuss. Tune in.. When I look at George Floyd, Breonna Taylor &amp; Ahmaud Arbery, I see my family. What happened to them could just have easily happened to the people I love. It<U+0092>s a painful reality that Black people across our nation confront every day &amp; every single time a new name starts trending.. The pain many Black communities are experiencing has been going on for centuries. That must be addressed. https://t.co/Xz3YQQwzfA. If you<U+0092>re able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota. 
https://t.co/t8LXowKIbw. A gut-wrenching and powerful moment when George Floyd's brother visited the site of his death.
https://t.co/DwDE2N9Mwh. It<U+0092>s been one week since George Floyd was murdered and the other three officers involved still have not been held accountable.. Because Marsha P. Johnson, Storm<e9> DeLarverie, Sylvia Rivera, and countless other LGBTQ+ people had the courage to stand up for their rights, we now celebrate #PrideMonth. Those pivotal events showed what we know to be true to this day: no one should be left to fight alone.. From the time a Black woman gives birth to her child, she prays to God that they will be safe. That no one will harm them because of the color of their skin. That they won<U+0092>t become another trending hashtag.. Black communities have not received equal justice under law for centuries. Black blood has stained America<U+0092>s sidewalks. The pain is real. It<U+0092>s deep. It<U+0092>s legitimate. We must listen, acknowledge that, and take action to transform our communities.. .@JoyceBeatty, thank you for your leadership and putting yourself on the line for your constituents. When we stand together, change happens.
https://t.co/rEvxLzd4ys. Going to be on @CNN at 9pm ET to chat about the protests happening across our nation and why I joined one outside the White House earlier today.. Too often, Black parents have to sit their teenage children down and tell them they may be stopped, arrested, or even shot because of the color of their skin. Our nation<U+0092>s history of systemic racism and use of excessive force must be confronted so we can begin to heal.. Five years ago we lost a longstanding public servant, Beau Biden. You couldn<U+0092>t find a man with more principle and courage who cared deeply about his family and the nation he served. 

@JoeBiden and @DrBiden, thinking of you and the entire Biden family today. https://t.co/b4cEgwHlBs. George Floyd was murdered. 

We know the minutes, not seconds<U+0097>minutes<U+0097>the police officer pinned his knee to George<U+0092>s neck while he was begging to breathe. 

Every single officer involved must be held accountable. https://t.co/eCLG7sfjyK. The horrific killings of<U+00A0>George Floyd,<U+00A0>Breonna Taylor, and<U+00A0>Ahmaud<U+00A0>Arbery<U+00A0>are not isolated incidents but the result of broader systematic racism in our country.<U+00A0>I'll be on<U+00A0>@JoyAnnReid on @MSNBC at 7:15pm ET to discuss this and more. Tune in.. Joining<U+00A0>@rolandsmartin now to discuss the protests happening across the country and the latest news in the George Floyd case. https://t.co/vLPt0cFksB. There is no question Breonna Taylor should still be alive today. 

Her family deserves justice.
Her community deserves justice.

Last week @LucyMcBath and I called for an independent DOJ investigation into her killing by police. The officers involved must be held accountable.. The country saw live on-air the injustices Black Americans face, even when they do nothing wrong. Omar, the work you and your team are doing on the ground is more important than ever. Stay safe.
https://t.co/alph9XLnF8. When the world around us seems completely overwhelming, it's important we take a moment to connect with our loved ones and neighbors.

Structural racism has influenced how laws in America are enforced. This is not new. It<U+0092>s been going on for generations. But we can<U+0097>and we must<U+0097>reform these systems and hold those accountable who abuse them.. .@Bakari_Sellers, thank you for sharing your pain that so many Black parents across our nation are experiencing. It shouldn't have to be this way. https://t.co/EYlowenmbp. Today at 12pm ET I<U+0092>m going live on Instagram with @chefjoseandres. Can<U+0092>t wait to chat about our FEED Act and what we can do to address the hunger crisis and help local restaurants during this pandemic (and hopefully swap some cooking tips!). Larry Kramer was a fierce advocate for the LGBTQ+ community who used his voice to hold people in power accountable. We are a better nation because he fought to end the stigma around HIV. Thinking of his loved ones during this difficult time. 
https://t.co/cVods4bVuR. Tune in to @AC360 tonight at 8:15pm ET as I sit down with @andersoncooper to discuss the heartbreaking milestone our nation surpassed today<U+0097>100,000 lives lost to coronavirus.

So much of this suffering was preventable but we can take action now to reduce the spread.. There is so much at stake in November and we have the power to elect officials who will work for the people, not special interests.

Today at 5pm ET, tune in to #StateOfWomenTV<U+0097>@USOWomen<U+0092>s Instagram Live series<U+0097>as @ValerieJarrett and I discuss how we make voting safe and accessible during this pandemic.. My heart is heavy this morning thinking about George Floyd<U+0092>s family. It<U+0092>s not enough to fire the officers<U+0097>they must be held accountable and an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department<U+0092>s practices must be opened. His family deserves justice. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd. Neighborhood bodegas, hair salons, and food trucks are struggling. I partnered with @AyannaPressley on the Saving Our Street Act to ensure local businesses that are historically disenfranchised can not only weather the storm but benefit from an inclusive path forward.. Over 1.6 million people in the United States have tested positive for coronavirus.
Almost 100,000 have died.
Nearly 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment. 

Trump was briefed on this threat in January. This full-blown public health crisis didn<U+0092>t have to happen.. Democrats at every level can benefit from NDTC<U+0092>s free training and resources. Their commitment to helping @TrainDems across the country is what our party needs to be successful in this cycle and for years to come. Check out their weekly virtual trainings: https://t.co/tiOry3idcn. Nearly 100,000 Americans have died from coronavirus and there is still no adequate national testing strategy.. Here's the sad reality: what happened to George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery &amp; Christian Cooper has gone on for generations to Black Americans. Cell phones just made it more visible.

Dismantling systemic racism in our nation starts with demanding justice &amp; holding offenders accountable.. Great news coming out of South Carolina. We must expand vote-by-mail nationwide. My VoteSafe Act would provide states with the resources to invest in vote-by-mail and ensure all voters can safely cast their ballot. 
https://t.co/rQzemN3crw. Memorial Day can be particularly tough for some veterans. If you or a veteran you know are struggling, help is here.

https://t.co/qTrzWWJsD4. Today we honor the heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation and our freedom. While our Memorial Day commemorations may be different today than in years past, we must never forget their devotion to putting country over self.. One-fifth! This is why I called for $2,000 recurring monthly payments with @BernieSanders and @EdMarkey. Bills don<U+0092>t stop just because of a global pandemic. 
https://t.co/DH06kfFxxP. Donald Trump<U+0092>s race-baiting has recklessly put the lives of Asian Americans and Asian immigrants at risk. 

Read my op-ed with @RobBonta<U+2192>
https://t.co/kiM9jah35H. This is exactly why I announced legislation to establish a racial and ethnic disparities task force. 

Unless the federal government provides an equitable response to communities hardest hit, these inequalities will continue to be exacerbated.

Zoom in. 

They were more than just a number, with family and friends who are grieving their loss. https://t.co/kXKQFYwkWD. Eid Mubarak to everyone celebrating in the United States and around the world. Whether you are near or far from loved ones, wishing you and yours a joyous and safe celebration.. There are two systems of justice in America: friends of Trump get released to home confinement during the pandemic while other low-risk, vulnerable people remain in overcrowded prisons. It<U+0092>s not right. https://t.co/dSt9qwcLbg. USPS delivers medicine to our nation<U+0092>s seniors. It helps small businesses in rural America and ensures that people are able to safely cast their ballots. Yet Trump and his administration are actively threatening the USPS<U+0092> funding in the middle of a pandemic. We will fight this.. Across our country, reproductive rights are under attack. Missouri Republicans championed a law banning abortion at 8 weeks, even in cases of rape and incest<U+0097>but Democratic women like @NicoleRGalloway and @AlissiaCanady are fighting back. 
https://t.co/rCNDpIgiQj. It<U+0092>s an unspeakable tragedy what happened to Breonna Taylor. @LucyMcBath and I are calling on the Department of Justice to immediately launch an independent investigation into her killing. 

Her family deserves answers and accountability.
https://t.co/V70qvR1wPJ. Congratulations to the HBCU Class of 2020 on all of your accomplishments! I can<U+0092>t wait to see the mark you make on the world. #UndefeatedHBCUDay
https://t.co/RG6bV2vQYe. Folks deserve to know why there is no national testing strategy for coronavirus.

They deserve to know the death toll statistics are accurate and free from political interference.

They deserve to know whether HHS can ensure testing and treatment is free for all Americans.. Gary's ramen restaurant has gotten calls asking <U+0093>can I order coronavirus?<U+0094> His employee was attacked while doing laundry. 

Unfortunately their experiences are not unique. Let's be clear: any attacks against Asian Americans are attacks on us all. 
https://t.co/tBhtlPBRVp. Families across our nation were already going to bed on an empty stomach before this crisis hit. Now demand at some food banks has increased by as much as 600%. We must pass the FEED Act and my bill to expand nutrition assistance. Now. 
https://t.co/Hc0ec2eDKb. HBCU grads, get ready to celebrate. Tomorrow I<U+0092>m joining leaders across our nation for #UndefeatedHBCUDay, an entire day to celebrate the HBCU class of 2020 on @theundefeated. https://t.co/ldLTfB2h8g. California<U+0092>s first openly LGBTQ+ elected official Harvey Milk once said, <U+0093>Hope will never be silent.<U+0094> Throughout his life and even after his death, he showed that fighting for everyone<U+0092>s civil rights is in our common interest. No one should be left to fight alone. #HarveyMilkDay. 100 days ago I attended a Homeland Security committee meeting about the coronavirus.

...No current Trump administration public health officials showed up.

Now nearly 95,000 Americans have died due to Trump<U+0092>s incompetence.. It could not be more clear that John Ratcliffe was confirmed as Director of National Intelligence because he<U+0092>s a dedicated soldier for Trump<U+0092>s political agenda. https://t.co/XTFnKwbth9. A man followed a Chinese-American doctor <U+0093>spewing a profanity-laced racist tirade as she walked to the subway. <U+0091>Why are you Chinese people killing everyone?<U+0092><U+0094>

There is no place for hatred in our country and these racist attacks must be condemned.
https://t.co/ymyKH6JgR6. .@realDonaldTrump, it is a federal crime to withhold money from states with the purpose of interfering with people's right to vote.
 
You may want to talk to your lawyer Bill Barr about that.. #BreonnaTaylor dedicated her life to taking care of other people before she was senselessly killed. 

There needs to be an investigation. https://t.co/FYDWime0yC. It<U+0092>s been over 100 years since the 19th Amendment passed in the House. Yet the struggle for access to the ballot box continues<U+0097>especially for women of color. We can<U+0092>t stop fighting to expand early voting and automatic voter registration to reduce those barriers.. TODAY at 7pm ET I<U+0092>m joining a national call for #WomenForBiden. There<U+0092>s still time to register: https://t.co/BT2SUJKsT2 https://t.co/ObN4M7Y6YY. Small businesses, particularly minority-owned businesses, in many communities are bearing the brunt of this economic crisis. Here<U+0092>s what we can do to save them.
https://t.co/SBR2O4bpf1. In third grade I loved to make scrambled eggs topped with cheese in the shape of a smiley face. While my specialties have expanded over the years, my love for cooking and how it can bring people together hasn't changed.
https://t.co/dFg2GOVudv. TUNE IN: Tonight at 7pm ET I'm joining @JoyAnnReid on @MSNBC to chat about what we can do to ensure voters can safely cast their ballot in November and the latest efforts to combat coronavirus.. Thank you, @AlexPadilla4CA, for calling it like it is. It's disgraceful the president of the United States is trying to undermine faith in our elections.
https://t.co/Mp6scFjzM5. Our federal government is once again failing our Tribal and Native communities. Do not look away from this tragedy. 

I<U+0092>m continuing to push for additional funding for Tribal and Urban Indian Health facilities. We must act quickly to ensure they get support to combat coronavirus. https://t.co/iAgjht5MT9. Excited to join #WomenForBiden for a national call tomorrow at 7pm ET to discuss Trump<U+0092>s failed leadership during this unprecedented crisis and why @JoeBiden<U+0092>s steady leadership is more important than ever. Sign up now: https://t.co/BT2SUJKsT2 https://t.co/kX15CRZgrM. .@RonJohnsonWI<U+0092>s Senate Homeland Security Committee subpoena vote today is just another way to score cheap political points. We should be prioritizing protecting Americans during this pandemic<U+0097>not partisan political matters. This is a clear abdication of responsibility.. Trump and McConnell continue to stack our courts with unqualified, inexperienced right-wing judges who will make decisions on everything from the ACA to worker's rights.

The future of our courts is on the ballot in November.. Ghost gun sales have surged during this pandemic. In order to keep our communities safe, I cosponsored the Untraceable Firearms Act. Requiring serial numbers for ghost gun parts and background checks for buyers is just common sense.
https://t.co/dWVpbFamml. @_allymaldonado Ally, thank you for your courage to speak truth and for letting us share your story with the world. Never stop fighting.. More than 90,000 Americans have died from coronavirus. They were business owners, domestic workers, doctors, and musicians.

They were mothers, brothers, aunts, and friends.

Thinking of the families shattered by grief and communities upended by loss. May time heal the pain.. Thank you, @AAPIVictoryFund, for having me yesterday. Together we can elect a Democratic Senate and put @JoeBiden in the White House. https://t.co/5OCB2a884M. Another attempt by Trump to distract and deflect accountability from his failure to prepare for the pandemic. As Trump neglects to lead, Americans are suffering and dying<U+0097>we must focus on how we can help them.
https://t.co/QbAYJ8x8u0. Voting is a fundamental right that people have fought and died for. We must protect it. My VoteSafe Act would:
<U+2192>Invest $2.5 billion to expand vote-by-mail and early voting
<U+2192>Provide $2.5 billion to improve the safety of polling places
<U+2192>No-excuse mail-in absentee voting. Lupe Martinez risked getting coronavirus at her nursing home job in order to pay the bills. Then she got sick.

Latinx workers are often the lowest-paid essential workers and shouldn<U+0092>t be forced to make these impossible decisions in order to survive.
https://t.co/6EeudNI5qT. My message to @MomsDemand and all other gun safety advocates: you are not only changing hearts and minds, but changing laws. Your work matters. https://t.co/gi3NBep0ql.

At 2pm ET today I<U+0092>m joining @JoeBiden and @AAPIVictoryFund at the AAPI Progressive Summit to chat about how we can combat the rise in hateful attacks against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants. We<U+0092>re all in this together. Register now: https://t.co/ENTNhb6qIW. They<U+0092>re trying to dismantle the United States Postal Service and privatize it. We must fight with every breath we have to make sure USPS workers are protected and everyone has access to reliable, affordable mail service. Congress must take immediate action to protect the USPS.. TOMORROW: I<U+0092>m joining @shannonrwatts and @everytown to discuss gun violence during the coronavirus era. Don<U+0092>t miss out on this important discussion. 
https://t.co/djrokF4cjg. 66 years ago Brown v. Board was decided and it changed the trajectory of my life. Without this decision, I likely wouldn<U+0092>t have become a lawyer or eventually be elected a Senator from California. 

Remember, the direction of the Supreme Court is on the ballot in November. Vote.. .@ChrisPappasNH, @AngieCraigMN, and @sharicedavids led the fight to get the Equality Act passed in the House one year ago today.

Now, they<U+0092>re up for reelection and the GOP wants nothing more than to defeat them and undo our progress. Can you chip in now?
https://t.co/8t80U6IPja. Thank you, @BarackObama.

From chairing the economics society to pledging @akasorority1908, my time at @HowardU helped make me who I am today.
https://t.co/d6pzxGTRUw. Late last night Trump fired the State Department Inspector General who had reportedly opened an investigation into Mike Pompeo. 

His firing must be investigated. Immediately.. Honored to be a part of #ShowMeYourWalk HBCU Edition today at 2pm ET to celebrate all the graduates who can<U+0092>t be with their classmates this month. Join us at https://t.co/hebpX4plTC. https://t.co/lwxQuolJJJ. .@MaraGay was young, healthy, and active. That all changed in the blink of an eye. 

The aftermath coronavirus is leaving in its wake is sobering. We can<U+0092>t become complacent.
https://t.co/XuhndpErPY. Reminder: in the middle of a pandemic Trump and his administration are actively trying to take away health care from millions of Americans.. @HeatherKenney17 I<U+0092>m saddened to hear of Brent<U+0092>s passing and send my prayers to his family and tribe. It<U+0092>s imperative we do more so our tribal and native communities can fight coronavirus. We can<U+0092>t leave them behind.. We<U+0092>ve seen the ramifications of an inaccurate death toll after Hurricane Maria and it<U+0092>s critical we don<U+0092>t repeat history. 

I<U+0092>m calling on FEMA and HHS to get their act together and have a federal standard for counting COVID-19 deaths so we can hold the government accountable.. As of May 13, more than 2,820 federal inmates and 266 staff have tested positive for coronavirus. It<U+0092>s unacceptable. 

I<U+0092>m calling for a hearing on the Federal Bureau of Prisons' inept response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
https://t.co/3uRGNl1Scz. It<U+0092>s unfathomable that this needs to be said, but airlines must give customers their money back for canceled flights<U+0097>not a travel voucher. 
https://t.co/7nQxMriRAE. Many workers risk contracting coronavirus or passing it along to their loved ones. They have every right to expect their workplace is taking the necessary precautions to protect their health and safety. https://t.co/FWg2wziHja. HBCU grads, it<U+0092>s time to celebrate. This Saturday, May 16 at 2pm ET I<U+0092>m a part of #ShowMeYourWalk HBCU Edition, a livestream graduation event celebrating the class of 2020. Come celebrate with us: https://t.co/hebpX4plTC https://t.co/YU4KnpUWXH. Dr. Bright's testimony today confirmed it: there's no leadership, no plan.

The Trump administration repeatedly ignored warnings.
His reckless delays cost lives.
And there still aren't enough tests.

Scientists should be leading the way<U+0097>not the failed occupant of the White House.. LIVE: Joining @ColorOfChange and @rashadrobinson to discuss the economic and health impacts coronavirus is having on our communities. #TheBlackResponse
https://t.co/czRJjwxOgH. Absolutely shameful the Wisconsin Supreme Court put politics above public health.
https://t.co/jcitrPg34X. Dr. Bright is right. The United States needs a national vaccine strategy now and it's alarming we don't have one. It's critical the vaccine is accessible for all<U+0097>not just the well-connected or wealthy.. Looking forward to joining @ColorOfChange and @rashadrobinson at 4:30pm ET today to discuss what Congress can do to protect Black communities and help minority-owned businesses. Be sure to tune in: https://t.co/FTtZzNRiEl https://t.co/voAw7Hfzx9. Absolutely staggering<U+0097>we must get to work and give people the relief they urgently need. That<U+0092>s why I<U+0092>m calling for recurring monthly payments, a suspension of credit card interest, fees, and penalties, and more money for food assistance. 
https://t.co/3qLZj2b5my. Turns out @AyannaPressley and I have a lot in common: we were both interns for the district or state we now represent. Thankful we get to extend these same opportunities to young people today. https://t.co/t2uzvuAUAl. One thing is clear: Dr. Fauci puts the wellbeing of the American people first.

God only knows what kind of repercussions he will face for speaking truth yesterday. https://t.co/schWlYokRp. Tomorrow night at 7pm ET I<U+0092>m joining @JahanaHayesCT and @Lily_NEA for a tele-town hall on what we can do to help students and educators throughout this pandemic. RSVP<U+2192>
https://t.co/YCTMxu7WfR. Thank you, @MoveOn, for honoring the nearly 85,000 lives we've lost to coronavirus in the United States so far. It didn't have to be this way.
https://t.co/XJehHVBaRU. I'm calling for the Department of Justice to investigate #BreonnaTaylor's death. Her family deserves answers.
https://t.co/f0Dkov5D5R. Aimee Stephens refused to be silenced. She knew the fight for equality must be fought and won with each generation and we are all better because she had the courage to fight. Sending my love to her wife Donna during this time. 
https://t.co/C0gzkVtUyJ. There are two systems of justice in America: one for Trump and his cronies and another one for Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. https://t.co/f0Dkov5D5R. Floridians: @Organize2020FL is hosting a vote by mail virtual campaign kickoff tomorrow. Sign up today to learn how to get involved in your community and make sure our November elections are safe.
https://t.co/7kXhuVPXFQ. .@AyannaPressley and I stand on the shoulders of the great Shirley Chisholm<U+0097>and today we chatted about everything from racial disparities to Mother's Day in her presence.<U+00A0>

Watch the full video here:<U+00A0>https://t.co/x9PPSsfEdM https://t.co/VFeBusAQxC. Going live on Instagram with @AyannaPressley at 3:15pm ET today to discuss our Saving Our Street Act. Neighborhood and local businesses are the lifeblood of our communities and we must do more to make sure their doors are still open after this pandemic.. Excited to announce my VoteSafe Act is being introduced in the House by @ClyburnSC06 and @mlfudge. It: 
<U+2192>Expands vote-by-mail
<U+2192>Ensures in-person voting is safe
<U+2192>Requires 20+ days of early voting

People shouldn<U+0092>t have to choose between their health and their right to vote.. Spread the word to your friends and family: There are special elections in #CA25 and #WI07 today and it<U+0092>s critical people safely turn out for @ChristyforCA25 and @TriciaforWI. One vote can make a difference.. Ahmaud Arbery was fatally shot in broad daylight and it's a miscarriage of justice that it took so long to make arrests.

I'm demanding the Department of Justice launch an independent investigation into this case.. Tomorrow voters in #WI07 have the opportunity to elect @TriciaforWI and bring some overdue change to Wisconsin. But it's going to take everyone coming together to flip this seat blue. Know your voting options to keep you and your family healthy: https://t.co/HwlLm7r8fl. Congratulations Nicholas Johnson! You may be the first, but I know you won't be the last. Keep using your gifts to show the next generation of young Black leaders what<U+0092>s possible.
https://t.co/g3bydGIW3i. This says it all: Trump<U+0092>s image is more important to him than American lives.

Nearly 80,000 people have died. Where are the tests?
https://t.co/gnqgSwcKtL. Trump is trying to tweet his way into flipping #CA25<U+0097>we won<U+0092>t let him. 

Tomorrow, voters have the chance to elect @ChristyforCA25 to Congress. This race is close and every dollar counts to getting her over that finish line. Can you chip in now?
https://t.co/ftKlvCzBi0. In the past few weeks I<U+0092>ve introduced legislation that would:
<U+2705>Provide people $2,000 monthly payments throughout this crisis
<U+2705>Establish a racial &amp; ethnic disparities task force
<U+2705>Get money in the hands of minority-owned &amp; micro-businesses

People are suffering. We must act<U+0097>now.. A one-time $1,200 payment is nowhere near enough. Congress must immediately pass my bill to help people make ends meet. 
https://t.co/PzeVqF9sD3. Today I<U+0092>m thinking about the mothers who are in jail simply because they can<U+0092>t afford to make bail. It<U+0092>s unjust, but especially during this pandemic. It<U+0092>s past time we reform our broken bail system. #FreeBlackMamas. No one should ever go to the emergency room and not have their needs taken seriously.

But for too many Black mothers, that's the reality when they walk through those doors, driven in part by implicit bias in our health care system.

My Maternal CARE Act would help change that.. This is my story of a mother who proved the naysayers and doubters wrong every single time. On this Mother<U+0092>s Day, thank you to @culinary226 for all the mothers you stand for and letting me share my story with you.
https://t.co/CWyYgl0p8k. We can support mothers not just today<U+0097>but every day<U+0097>by making childcare affordable, passing equal pay protections, and making paid family and sick leave a reality nationwide. #MothersDay. Shyamala Harris was no more than 5 ft tall, but if you ever met her you would think she was 7 ft tall. She had such spirit and tenacity and I<U+0092>m thankful every day to have been raised by her. Happy #MothersDay to all the mothers, stepmothers, and mother figures celebrating today. https://t.co/H8JLntWrCW. It<U+0092>s just common sense as rent comes due and bills start to pile up during this crisis: we need to give people $2,000 monthly payments so they can make ends meet.
https://t.co/3LV757qxtU. Now more than ever we need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot who will lift up and represent our communities in need. Proud to endorse these leaders who are ready to do that from day one. 
https://t.co/Le3VJ4maGY. From bodegas to food trucks, we can<U+0092>t leave behind the micro-businesses that are the lifeblood of our communities. This week I introduced the Saving Our Street Act with @AyannaPressley to do just that. https://t.co/IQGLBGwPbc. Another legend taken from us. Unapologetically himself, Little Richard, the architect of rock <U+0092>n<U+0092> roll forged a path in both music and style so other artists could emulate. The world is a better and brighter place because of his music.. Congratulations to the @HowardU Class of 2020! You are joining a long line of graduates who have forged the way forward for our country and our world. Know your Bison family is with you every step on this new journey. #HU20. Such a tragic loss for the music industry and for all of us.<U+00A0>Andre's genius paved the way for so many of the<U+00A0>kings and queens of hip hop and R&amp;B. Sending my love to his family and friends during this difficult time. https://t.co/vdA26AGFgr. My grandmother traveled across India, bullhorn in hand, to talk to women about accessing birth control. Fighting for critical health care is who I am &amp; I won't stop pushing back against Republicans' shameful attempts to restrict birth control. Women deserve better. #HandsOffMyBC. My Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act with @BernieSanders and @EdMarkey would:
<U+2705>Provide a monthly $2,000 payment to individuals, including children
<U+2705>Last throughout this pandemic and for three months after
<U+2705>Debt collectors would be forbidden from seizing the payments. Once again, California is leading the way. We need to do everything we can to make sure our elections are safe in November. I urge Congress to pass my VoteSafe Act to do just that.
https://t.co/C65jFqYoph. Ahmaud should have turned 26 today. He should be alive, celebrating with his family and friends. 

Instead, people around the world came together to commemorate his life and passion for running.
https://t.co/s55FrKBp67. HBCU and first-generation students deserve to be celebrated<U+0097>even if graduation is canceled. I teamed up with We Got Us to celebrate our graduates and their accomplishments. https://t.co/YQl5kAY72g. .@RepMaxineWaters, sending my love and deepest condolences for your devastating loss. Keeping you and your family in our prayers during this time. 
https://t.co/H21quE5qX5. Today I<U+0092>m introducing a bill with @BernieSanders and @EdMarkey to provide $2,000 monthly payments to people during<U+0097>and for three months after<U+0097>this crisis. 

A one-time payment is not enough. 
https://t.co/YBHTxMbZ3D. It<U+0092>s absurd. We<U+0092>re in the middle of a global health crisis and Trump wants to <U+0093>terminate<U+0094> the Affordable Care Act, stripping coverage from millions of Americans.
https://t.co/3quCep5sKf. It<U+0092>s heartbreaking and infuriating that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, 1 in 5 children are going hungry. Passing the FEED Act and my bill to expand access to nutrition assistance has never been more important.
https://t.co/mhclramudr. Election Day is less than six months away. I<U+0092>m joining @MoveOn to discuss my VoteSafe Act and the investments we need to make now so states are prepared to ensure elections are fair and accessible for all.
https://t.co/qv7zaRxjte. Bill Barr has consistently done Donald Trump's bidding and corrupted our justice system. I called for it last year and I'll say it again: he must resign. https://t.co/atbmMMQRLw. Joining<U+00A0>@NicolleDWallace on @DeadlineWH on @MSNBC at 4:15pm to discuss the Justice Department news and what Congress can do to help businesses in need during this crisis.. The Trump administration is deliberately suppressing information from our nation<U+0092>s top disease experts during a pandemic where more than 73,000 Americans have died.
https://t.co/LU97Q7Bax0. Week after week the number of Americans who<U+0092>ve filed for unemployment continues to grow<U+0097>now more than 33 million total. Folks need relief. Now.

Congress must immediately pass recurring monthly payments and expand nutrition assistance to ensure people don<U+0092>t go hungry.. Yesterday my colleagues and I introduced the FEED Act with @chefjoseandres to help feed people in need while supporting our local restaurants. Too many Americans are going to bed hungry during this crisis<U+0097>but we can fix it.. A payroll tax cut would gut Social Security and Medicare funding.

And let<U+0092>s be clear: payroll tax cuts don<U+0092>t help if you aren<U+0092>t on a payroll. This should be a non-starter.
https://t.co/uYR0msoV9A. Ahmaud was only 25-years-old before his life was taken. No words or actions can ever ease the pain his family is feeling right now but they deserve swift justice. #JusticeForAhmaud https://t.co/p8aUxM5ap3. Local businesses make our communities great. Yet too many are struggling to stay open. Today I introduced the Saving Our Street Act with @AyannaPressley to set up a fund to get money in the hands of micro-businesses who need it most. 
https://t.co/7cbFq6N0QK. To all our nation<U+0092>s nurses, but especially those on the front lines of this crisis, thank you for the physical and emotional care you provide every day. But thanks isn<U+0092>t enough. We must fight to ensure all health care professionals have adequate PPE. #NationalNursesDay. Once again this administration is trying to control women<U+0092>s bodies. It<U+0092>s simple<U+0097>denying birth control coverage will cost women more.
https://t.co/uDuy51jqq6. When I asked Rep. Ratcliffe during his confirmation hearing today if he thought Trump accurately told Americans how serious the coronavirus threat was, he said, ""I believe so.""

Let's recap: Trump repeatedly said it was ""under control."" Now more than 69,000 people are dead.. @genebsperling Congratulations, Gene! Now more than ever, we must work to ensure that all Americans have an economy that allows them to to lead lives of dignity. I look forward to reading it.. Native American tribes like the Navajo Nation are contracting coronavirus at disproportionately high rates. The Treasury must immediately distribute the $8 billion in relief funds for Tribes. They can<U+0092>t wait.
https://t.co/4buJPF5R95. The video of #AhmaudArbery sickens me to my core.

Exercising while Black shouldn't be a death sentence.
https://t.co/GV7GFju7tr. Coronavirus deaths are projected to hit 3,000 people per day by June<U+0097>that<U+0092>s the number of people we lost during 9/11. Every. Single. Day.

Reminder: This full-blown public health crisis didn<U+0092>t have to happen. But Trump and his administration failed Americans.. @nhannahjones The #1619Project was a masterpiece and a necessary reckoning of our nation's history. Thank you, Nikole, for your contribution and congratulations on your Pulitzer!. A long overdue and well-deserved recognition for Ida B. Wells<U+0092> intrepid investigative journalism that exposed the horrors of lynchings and other
dark, despicable parts of our nation<U+0092>s history.
https://t.co/DwQBwrprAR. .@katieporteroc and I are teaming up to support @ChristyforCA25 who is on the ballot in #CA25 one week from today.

Her opponent is running to repeal the ACA and back Trump's agenda.

With your help, we can make a difference in this close race.
https://t.co/43o50pMERc. Amber Isaac<U+0092>s tragic story is all too common for Black women and my heart aches for her family. 
 
This isn<U+0092>t about education or socioeconomics. There is implicit bias in our health care system. My Maternal CARE Act would help solve this epidemic. 
https://t.co/15A4eTXydX. Thank you, @JoeBiden, for putting forward a comprehensive Black Agenda that begins to address the structural inequities in our nation<U+0092>s policies, as well as the urgent need for a racial and ethnic disparities task force. Together we can #LiftEveryVoice.
https://t.co/TNqAzibPrY. Dangerous living conditions.
Inadequate medical care.

This humanitarian crisis along our border didn't have to happen<U+0097>it was created by Trump's xenophobic actions. A powerful piece reminding us we can't turn a blind eye.
https://t.co/ZWBPs3xncX. We can defeat Trump, take back the Senate, protect our House majority, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot by ensuring Latino voters turn out in record numbers. <U+2063>
 <U+2063>
Donate to @latinovictoryus on their 6th anniversary to make it happen: https://t.co/ZscaJf6WWy. I know the power teachers have to change lives. While teaching may look a little different these days, thank you to those going above and beyond for your students. Your work matters and I won't stop fighting until you get a much-needed raise. #TeacherAppreciationWeek. Unconscionable. Betsy DeVos is failing our nation<U+0092>s students right and left during this pandemic and must be held accountable. 
https://t.co/DiB3TrFMIb. Sadly<U+0097>but not surprisingly<U+0097>the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on communities of color reflects long-standing inequities in our health care and economic systems.

This week I announced legislation to create a racial and ethnic disparities task force to combat this. https://t.co/7vFip4JEqT. Trump cuts down and attacks the press at every turn because he doesn<U+0092>t like the truth. On #WorldPressFreedomDay, we must never lose sight that a free press is the bedrock of our democracy. It<U+0092>s more important than ever.. Cavanaugh Bell, aka @cooldopeliving, used his life savings to make coronavirus care packages for the elderly<U+0097>and then started a community pantry. Grateful I had the opportunity to meet this inspiring seven-year-old. https://t.co/xueyjiNUIX. Incredible news. I introduced the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights and I<U+0092>m proud to see Philadelphia leading the charge in their state. Domestic workers, many of whom are women of color and immigrants, deserve basic protections<U+0097>especially in times like these. https://t.co/BG5uB6caCL. Once again the White House is trying to muzzle public health experts.

My colleagues in the House have the right to hear from Dr. Fauci. 
https://t.co/AxSPYt8eyv. To all high school seniors across the country, #CollegeSigningDay was just the first step in your journey. We're with you every step of the way.

And of course, an extra special welcome to those who chose my alma mater, @HowardU. Congratulations!. With the recent disturbing reports of increased hate towards Asian Americans and Asian immigrants, the critical work of @AAPIVictoryFund and the #StopAAPIHate Reporting Center is more important than ever. https://t.co/qFH7WnQnu7. Absolutely unconscionable. Once again Republicans are putting profits over workers<U+0092> health and personal safety. 
https://t.co/vHxi43SrxK. My mother had the ability to dream anything was possible. Born in India, she came to the United States alone at age 19 with the hope of curing cancer. This #APAHM, I<U+0092>m thinking of her and other members of the AAPI community who overcame obstacles to make the world a better place. https://t.co/CdgHPiJr87. No better way to kick off a Friday than cooking with @TomColicchio, chatting about everything from how we can help local restaurants during this crisis to @douglasemhoff's onion goggles.
Watch the full convo here:<U+00A0>https://t.co/Ovvmmdtxcv https://t.co/hutIXgZQZd. Front line workers at large corporations like Amazon and Instacart deserve PPE. They deserve paid sick leave. They deserve a safe working environment. 

But many don<U+0092>t have these protections. 

I stand with those on strike today for safe working conditions. #MayDay. Long-standing inequalities have been pushed to the forefront by this crisis which is why I'm announcing legislation to establish a racial disparities task force.

It's crucial we track data and provide response recommendations for communities hit hardest.
https://t.co/4Iyi4eZLU3. Looking forward to tonight<U+0092>s @akasorority1908 COVID-19 virtual town hall with my Sorors. Tune in at 8pm ET.
https://t.co/CsCNQ8AzyH. Great news. Thank you @UofCalifornia and @calstate for stepping up to provide relief to DACA students and Dreamers after the Trump administration denied them financial support.
https://t.co/vTPEA6wm3W. Congratulations, @valeisha, on your next chapter! We are all stronger when a diversity of voices are at the decision table.
https://t.co/5dlR2sDkUH. Today at 3:45pm ET I<U+0092>m joining @tedlieu and @MSNBC Anchor @RichardLui for an important conversation on the rise of hate against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants and what we can do for our AAPI community heading into #APAHM. https://t.co/v09rQ1ZoOr. Absolutely devastating<U+0097>more than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment since this crisis started. 

A one time $1,200 payment is nowhere near enough for folks struggling to pay rent and feed their families. We need recurring payments and more money for food assistance.. The fight for equal pay is far from over, but it's leaders like @AllysonFelix who are at the forefront to end this fundamental unfairness. https://t.co/nvNSZex09b. .@AllysonFelix's maternal health story is all too common for Black women in our nation. It has to change. I introduced the Maternal CARE Act to ensure women are listened to and taken seriously in our health care system.

Watch our full Instagram Live here:<U+00A0>https://t.co/cPCJAQr3rE https://t.co/kIpn3iq0qp. The number of coronavirus cases linked to the Wisconsin primary continues to grow. Passing my VoteSafe Act is imperative to keep voters healthy. It includes:
<U+2705>Expanding vote-by-mail
<U+2705>Publishing wait times at polls
<U+2705>Expanding early voting
<U+2705>Curbside voting. In just a few short hours at 3pm ET @AllysonFelix and I will be going live on Instagram for <U+0091>A Conversation with Kamala.<U+0092> Hope you<U+0092>ll tune in as we discuss the important issues facing women and communities of color today.. Rana Zoe tried to get a coronavirus test multiple times but her pain was dismissed. 

This tragedy is all too common for Black folks across our nation. Confronting racial health disparities and increasing test production must be prioritized during this crisis. https://t.co/LM3miDVotW. It<U+0092>s appalling that minority-owned small businesses<U+0097>especially Black-owned businesses<U+0097>continue to be shut out from the Paycheck Protection Program. Mom-and-pop businesses are the backbone of our economy and deserve equal opportunity to funding. 
https://t.co/vbWwA2Tk79. Right now 2M immigrants in California, including essential workers, are facing economic uncertainty because of coronavirus and cannot access federal relief. I<U+0092>m joining @GavinNewsom in trying to raise $50M for the California Immigrant Resilience Fund.
https://t.co/tNvCkxCuxY. Tomorrow on Instagram Live at 3pm ET join me for <U+0091>A Conversation with Kamala<U+0092> with six-time gold medalist @allysonfelix to talk about the postponement of the Olympics and discuss her firsthand experiences with our nation<U+0092>s Black maternal health crisis.. The president has the ability during times of crisis to help our most vulnerable communities and those who are suffering. We<U+0092>re certainly not getting that from this White House. 

Americans deserve new leadership. https://t.co/aXQIqlz6B2. More than 50,000 Americans have died from coronavirus and that number is growing every day. 

Trump had the opportunity to prepare and save lives<U+0097>but he failed to act swiftly.
https://t.co/lHhuEhimRZ. Trump lies to Americans, rejects facts, and is more concerned about himself than the people he represents.
Who is in the White House matters<U+0097>and why it's so important we work together to elect @JoeBiden in November. https://t.co/aConglR0me. Happy birthday to my dear friend and colleague, @CoryBooker. Wishing we could celebrate in person as you turn a year older but we<U+0092>ll just have to make the celebration next year even bigger. https://t.co/lmibDUpPPG.

https://t.co/1BJLc9xSOm. Go to https://t.co/lkNiXDXDXT to learn more about my friend @AndrewYang<U+0092>s new campaign to combat racism. We are all in this together. #AllAmericans
https://t.co/jYL146rprG. We've seen it again and again: communities already hurt by systemic inequalities are being hit hardest during this pandemic. Join me and Black community leaders at 3:30pm ET today as we discuss these disparities and how @JoeBiden has a plan to address it.
https://t.co/m5nCI2NiMg. I<U+0092>m focused not only on the present coronavirus situation but also on the future. When there is a vaccine we need to be prepared to ensure equal access for all<U+0097>not just the wealthy or well-connected. https://t.co/asNMdb27h4. <U+0093>The pandemic is reminding us that our belonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners, who <U+0091>brought<U+0092> the virus here.<U+0094> 

Thank you, @JohnTheCho, for this heartfelt piece. We must all call out attacks and hate against our Asian communities. https://t.co/pcrO3LQQzM. I applaud towns and school districts who are stepping up to ensure that students and adults in their communities have access to the internet. With three million students lacking basic internet access, investing in affordable broadband services is more important than ever before. https://t.co/Fg1oWfzJXh. Trump rejected coronavirus information from the American intelligence community.
He minimized the seriousness of this crisis.
He muzzled public health experts.

At a time when Americans are depending on competent leadership, he has failed again and again.. Tomorrow at 3:30pm ET, I'm hosting a virtual town hall with Black leaders to discuss the disproportionate impact coronavirus is having on communities of color. Sign up now to join us. 
https://t.co/thN3VD6uKB. This is ridiculous. USPS workers and the countless people who rely on the USPS for their small business, prescription drugs, as well as casting their ballot deserve better. 

Congress must immediately step in to ensure the USPS can continue delivering the mail. https://t.co/DyKb3CAXw9. Stephen Miller is the architect of Trump<U+0092>s Muslim ban and separating children from their families. I called on him to resign last year and stand by that today. https://t.co/6896XG4wMW. All too often, Native Americans are disenfranchised at the ballot box<U+0097>this is a victory for Native American voting rights.

In every state across our nation, a Tribal ID and recognition of Tribal street addresses should be sufficient to vote.
https://t.co/9RvWv6MWoL. More than 26 million Americans have become unemployed in the last five weeks. I introduced a bill to eliminate the strict work requirements for food and nutrition assistance. https://t.co/BxPxnvWEii. FEMA<U+0092>s disaster responses have long been plagued by racial and socioeconomic disparities, which could have devastating consequences for our most vulnerable communities during this pandemic. 

I led a letter to FEMA yesterday demanding they transparently address these disparities.. Thanks @marceelias for explaining why Trump can't change the election. We must start preparing for the November elections now. 

My VoteSafe Act would take the necessary steps to expand early voting and curbside voting to make sure voting is safe.
https://t.co/8Lg9cpjLcC. Today I<U+0092>m joining my friend @JoeBiden and people across our nation who are coming together to take part in #SOULSaturday. Let<U+0092>s use this moment to show our appreciation for those on the front lines and connect with our friends and neighbors. We're all in this together. https://t.co/pbZbw258T7. About to join @amjoyshow at 10 a.m. ET this morning on @MSNBC to discuss coronavirus and what more Congress can do to help hurting Americans. Be sure to tune in.. Wisconsin voters put their lives on the line to cast their ballot and now we're seeing coronavirus cases there being directly linked to voting. I joined @TamronHallShow yesterday to discuss how my VoteSafe Act will protect people at the polls come November. https://t.co/whxOvtZhdM. In 2019, 39% of college students didn<U+0092>t have access to healthy food in the past 30 days<U+0097>and this has only been exacerbated by campus closures from coronavirus. I joined my colleagues calling for critical nutritional assistance to be expanded so no college student goes hungry.. Wanted to make sure you saw this: McConnell is continuing his push to stack our courts with ideologue judges during the middle of a pandemic. It<U+0092>s clear where his priorities lie.
https://t.co/JN7wnpqZzJ. In times like these, it<U+0092>s important we come together to lift people up and help our neighbors. Add your name now to commit to taking action in your community this #SOULSaturday.
https://t.co/C3SepyPUKW. .@KeishaBottoms, I<U+0092>m outraged you and your daughter were exposed to this sickening and racist text. Know that Atlanta residents are better off because of your strong leadership.
https://t.co/laSnuJR5Sf. Right now we need a president that speaks truth, embraces science, and lifts people up<U+0097>Trump is incapable of any of that. https://t.co/8Py8AnMcCT. Awful news. @RepMaxineWaters, we are keeping your sister and your entire family in our prayers during this difficult time.
https://t.co/ljEa1mmXLR. The Affordable Care Act brought health care to millions of people who didn't have it. Bill Barr is trying to get rid of it in the midst of a public health crisis. https://t.co/j7m5aYN3bh. .@benschilibowl is a DC icon I used to eat at during my @HowardU days.
It's outrageous small businesses like Ben's Chili Bowl aren't getting the kind of relief the president's friends are getting. Congress must prioritize helping minority-owned businesses.
https://t.co/i9fHq92VMS. .@ChristyforCA25 is on the ballot on May 12. Donate now to help us ensure Californians in #CA25 have a fighter who represents them: https://t.co/3UrNwjW9F0 https://t.co/5mwvJuFMbl. All of society benefits from domestic workers and caregivers and the work they do every day. As I said to @CareInActionUSA, they shouldn<U+0092>t be excluded from the protections and benefits other workers receive, such as paid sick leave, child care relief, and hazard pay. https://t.co/FO0JuVQM3n. No one in America should ever go hungry, especially during a public health crisis. I'm leading a bill with @SenGillibrand and @BernieSanders to immediately expand access to nutrition assistance.
https://t.co/CVmUbNSQe7. Heartbreaking. @ewarren, you spoke so highly about Don on the campaign trail. Sending our condolences, prayers, and thoughts to you and the entire @TeamWarren family. https://t.co/VAnD4xigp1. Tune in today to the @TamronHallShow for a discussion on how coronavirus is exacerbating racial disparities. Check your local listing for times. You won<U+0092>t want to miss this..

https://t.co/IkfassE0Ng. This is downright cruel. Betsy DeVos proves once again she<U+0092>s unfit to serve all our nation<U+0092>s students. 
https://t.co/yACDdxwhXm. In the midst of this deadly pandemic, Trump has rolled back regulations to reduce harmful car emissions, advocated for a bailout for the fossil fuel industry, and let polluters disregard regulations.

His dangerous environmental policies will cost lives.

It<U+0092>s undeniable: there are many forces at work to stop people from voting and to make voting inaccessible. We must act now to ensure our November elections are protected. The first step<U+0097>pass my VoteSafe Act. https://t.co/tGH77TRCE5. There is no Planet B. 

On the 50th anniversary of #EarthDay, it<U+0092>s never been more important to tackle the climate crisis and stand up to this administration intent on destroying our environment and giving polluters a free pass. Not just for ourselves, but for future generations.. Absolutely shameful. States must urgently address the accessibility of their unemployment websites to ensure people with disabilities are able to access the resources they are entitled to during this crisis.
https://t.co/0RmvBHOvbC. I<U+0092>ll be taking part in @JoeBiden<U+0092>s #SOULSaturday and I hope you<U+0092>ll join me in thanking our nation<U+0092>s heroic essential workers and working to ensure they have the resources needed to safely do their jobs.
https://t.co/whWMKZ2Hg5. I fought price gouging during wildfires as California<U+0092>s Attorney General and I<U+0092>m continuing that fight today with @ewarren to make it illegal nationwide. Protecting consumers from being taken advantage of during times of crisis must be a priority.. Trump is trying to distract and deflect from his failure to address the ongoing pandemic.

To our immigrant community: know that we see you and we won<U+0092>t stop fighting against Trump<U+0092>s anti-immigrant agenda. https://t.co/GBNHDqTgqx. Donald Trump just endorsed @ChristyforCA25<U+0092>s opponent, who wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and fully supports his failing leadership. Donate now to make sure she wins May 12's special election and we keep #CA25 blue<U+2192>
https://t.co/yvUgDx3L1j. Election Day is less than 200 days away. States need funding and resources now to ensure everyone can safely cast their ballot. 

My VoteSafe Act would make that investment into early voting, vote-by-mail, and safety so states are prepared to tackle the challenges that lie ahead.. Even before this pandemic began, the Indian Health Service was severely underfunded. I won<U+0092>t stop fighting to give tribal and native communities the investments they deserve to fight coronavirus.
https://t.co/fZaidFJh4I. This public health crisis has shone a light on the gross disparities that existed based on race and income, long before we ever heard the word <U+0093>coronavirus.<U+0094> It<U+0092>s critical that HHS collect racial and ethnic data for coronavirus patients so we can better understand it. https://t.co/eMdhzMK68Z. The Senate must pass my Marijuana Opportunity Act to legalize marijuana at the federal level and expunge non-violent marijuana-related offenses from the records of the millions who<U+0092>ve been arrested or incarcerated. Too many lives have been ruined by these regressive policies.. ""She would stop what she was doing and tell me she loved me like 20x a day.""

Heartbroken for the Herbert family over their beautiful five-year-old Skylar.

We must keep fighting to ensure no other family has to endure the loss of a child to coronavirus.
https://t.co/EFLONduiBA. This should have happened ages ago. Trump has hindered our nation<U+0092>s efforts to combat coronavirus by failing to lead on testing from the very beginning.
https://t.co/qjIKBlPMtw. Let<U+0092>s speak truth: this pandemic further reinforces historic inequities, which have roots in slavery and Jim Crow laws, that remain persistent and profound to this very day.
https://t.co/TBTZEDuLkH. Trump continues to deflect accountability at every turn to try to hide his failure to prepare for the pandemic.

It wasn<U+0092>t the World Health Organization, governors, or the press who waited to act &amp; take this crisis seriously<U+0097>the lack of leadership falls squarely on his shoulders.. My VoteSafe Act would ensure no one would have to decide between their right to vote and their health.
https://t.co/y46QacA02R. The federal government must follow California<U+0092>s lead and open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act. Time to put aside partisan politics and give the millions of anxious and uninsured Americans peace of mind that they are protected during this public health crisis.. Americans deserve a comprehensive solution to ensure that voting is safe and accessible. Add your name to show your support for the VoteSafe Act I introduced this week.
https://t.co/9DG6OYlpcr. @Elpidophoros Wishing all Orthodox Christians a safe and happy Easter. May this day of resurrection be filled with light and love no matter where you are or how you<U+0092>re celebrating.. We cannot let minority-owned small businesses fall through the cracks of the Paycheck Protection Program. I joined my colleagues this week calling for data transparency on small business loans to make sure that people of color aren<U+0092>t being shut out from help during a pandemic.. Millions of Americans across our nation have bills to pay. They have families to feed. It<U+0092>s outrageous their stimulus checks may be subject to private debt collection. I led my colleagues calling for this to end.
https://t.co/4v5vark13I. Too many Black men have been racially profiled by law enforcement for wearing masks. @CoryBooker and I led a letter to Attorney General Barr today demanding bias training and guidance for all officers.
https://t.co/eNxBWsUJdq. Safety should be top-of-mind for the November election. My VoteSafe Act would do just that and give grants for states to:

<U+2705>Expand curbside voting
<U+2705>Publish current wait times for voters
<U+2705>Provide pre-paid postage for mail-in ballots. I<U+0092>ve demanded the federal government collect data on coronavirus racial disparities to understand its full scope and form a racial disparities task force to close those inequalities. Resources to communities that have been hit hardest by the pandemic must be prioritized.. There are two problems when it comes to Black maternal mortality: ongoing systematic disparities and implicit bias.

On the last day of Black Maternal Health Week, the urgency to pass the Black Maternal Health Momnibus and my Maternal CARE Act couldn<U+0092>t be more clear.. People have fought, bled, and died for our right to vote. Yesterday I introduced the VoteSafe Act to make sure our elections are more accessible and safe.
https://t.co/UxPo0BzGXf. Today I announced the VoteSafe Act. It includes:
<U+2192>$2.5 billion to expand vote-by-mail and early voting
<U+2192>$2.5 billion to improve safety of polling places
<U+2192>No-excuse mail-in absentee voting
<U+2192>At least 20 days of early voting 

Voting is a fundamental right. We must protect it.. No voter should ever have to make the choice between staying healthy and casting their ballot. I urge Congress to swiftly pass my VoteSafe Act.
https://t.co/3um8vejK8C. Thank you, Dr. @KizzyPhD, for leading the charge around the clock to develop a vaccine for coronavirus. The world owes you and your team a debt of gratitude. 
https://t.co/Zy1lN0qFvE. Another 5.2 million filed unemployment claims last week. It<U+0092>s more urgent than ever we suspend credit card interest fees and penalties, and implement recurring monthly payments. Americans are hurting and they need relief. Now.. From voting rights to health disparities, this pandemic is an opportunity to restructure already broken systems that are now too pronounced to ignore. 
https://t.co/m4HtvrWEfS. Today I announced the VoteSafe Act to ensure voting is safe and accessible during the coronavirus pandemic.

https://t.co/VIO69aRIX4. About to join @craigmelvin on @MSNBC to discuss the latest unemployment numbers and what we can do now to help families and small businesses. Be sure to tune in.. Let's talk about this<U+0097>the Trump administration needs to make it abundantly clear that debt collectors can<U+0092>t take money from the checks going to millions in need. https://t.co/l0s0LvwLkh. In the middle of a pandemic where we know air pollution is making people more vulnerable, this administration caved to polluters and disregarded the government's own scientists. It<U+0092>s indefensible.
https://t.co/SkvjBd0vwP. Reminder: Tax Day has been postponed until July 15, however, check with your state<U+0092>s department of taxation for your state filing and payment deadlines.. He<U+0092>s blamed the World Health Organization.
He<U+0092>s blamed governors.
He<U+0092>s blamed the media.

The list goes on and on.

Trump<U+0097>take responsibility and help Americans who are suffering and dying from your failures.. Absolutely shameful. Trump is more obsessed with bolstering his brand than getting quick relief to Americans who are struggling to get by. 
https://t.co/J3s0Yyem7C. @DrBiden Thank you, Dr. Biden, for sharing. We can<U+0092>t let up the fight to address maternal mortality in America.. We can<U+0092>t let the tens of thousands of Americans who<U+0092>ve died from coronavirus be reduced to just a number.

They were teachers, restaurant owners, nurses, and mothers who were loved dearly. A look at the lives of some of those we<U+0092>ve lost.
https://t.co/FPqNX9V1ug. I<U+0092>m in D.C. right now focused on what we can do to help families and small businesses<U+0097>not giant corporations. This includes:
<U+2192>Suspending credit card interest, fees, and penalties
<U+2192>Recurring monthly payments
<U+2192>Ban price gouging nationwide
<U+2192>Paid sick leave. Since stay at home orders were enacted, officials have seen an uptick in domestic violence and child abuse reports. 

I joined my colleagues in calling for further funding for family violence shelters, the @ndvh, and tribal organizations that combat intimate partner violence. https://t.co/AXziYk2q4j. Trump can<U+0092>t have it both ways. Thankful that while there has been a crisis of leadership from the White House, governors have stepped up and taken the lead. 
https://t.co/VaqJAxblkM. It could not be more clear: the future of the Supreme Court<U+0097>and voting rights<U+0097>is on the ballot in November. https://t.co/hyFlWm3YO1. This pandemic has shed light on something many of us have known: there are deep existing disparities in our country<U+0092>s health care system, especially when it comes to the maternal health of Black women.

It's critical that we confront these realities with immediate solutions. https://t.co/n2i5nUuS7e. Add your name if you agree: we must suspend credit card interest, fees, and penalties until after this crisis is over.
https://t.co/hmoQxk3rJ4. From the beginning of this pandemic Trump has tried to minimize and distract from the crisis at hand. 

It<U+0092>s led to rationing of resources.
Reduced testing. 
More deaths.

Americans deserve better.. Mayor @LondonBreed took extraordinary political heat for her swift action to combat coronavirus in San Francisco. Her leadership saved lives. 
https://t.co/TjydRUEys5. At a time when Americans desperately need national leadership, this White House has failed.

<U+274C>Fewer than 10 retail drive-through testing sites in the entire country
<U+274C>No national screening website
<U+274C>Not enough tests

https://t.co/pDkubhe3IS. Today I<U+0092>m thinking about the families across our nation who are having their first holiday without their uncle, their grandma, their dad, or other loved one because they lost them to coronavirus. May they be able to find strength and healing in community and love.. A powerful message from Pope Francis this Easter morning. Let us use this moment in time to become a #BuilderOfChange, refocus on the common good, and put ""human life and dignity at the centre"" of all that we do<U+2192> https://t.co/3iFSgzhnkg. Easter may be a little different this year than others, but I hope you get the chance to be virtually close to your loved ones today. Let us all remember that even when things seem dark, there is always reason for hope. https://t.co/oLyZ2HnIgi. Another inexcusable proposal by the Trump administration. Many farm workers are already vastly underpaid and doing backbreaking work to put food on our tables. 

They deserve a raise<U+0097>not a pay cut.
https://t.co/J0K2cCytqk. Taking the Census is safe, confidential, and critical to ensuring our communities get the resources we need for things like public schools, Medicaid, and Head Start. Go to https://t.co/p84Gzk22Nk now to make sure you<U+0092>re counted. https://t.co/SYc29NVoJ4. Yesterday Trump said, ""We have masks. We have everything...We<U+0092>re in great shape.""

Reality:
https://t.co/YSTkEzaAUa. As Attorney General of CA, I fought price gouging during wildfires, and I<U+0092>m proud to introduce a bill with @ewarren to make price gouging illegal nationwide. We have to do what we can to protect consumers against those who<U+0092>d take advantage of a crisis like the coronavirus.. <U+0093>The other day, I got stopped in the subway and one of the passengers started screaming racial slurs at me. I was dressed in scrubs....<U+0094>

Scrubs or no scrubs, this is not okay. We must speak out against attacks on Asian Americans and Asian immigrants.
https://t.co/qJ1nfhfBTe. Coronavirus continues to amplify racial inequalities in our nation. No one should ever be criminalized for wearing a mask to protect their health.
https://t.co/83TXAR3vmv. If you can, please consider giving to @theworkerslab Worker<U+0092>s Fund, which gives assistance to underpaid workers who find themselves struggling to make ends meet during this pandemic. Your support will make a difference in the lives of thousands of workers<U+2192>https://t.co/O8BTkTLDCQ https://t.co/YzDmpVFGTh. More than 16M Americans have filed for unemployment in the past three weeks.

Even when the paychecks stop coming, people still need to feed their families and pay the bills.

That<U+0092>s why I called for the suspension of credit card fees, penalties, and interest. People need relief.. Happy 90th birthday to my dear friend and iconic labor rights leader, @DoloresHuerta. Your commitment to fighting for farm worker and immigrant rights is truly an inspiration to us all. May your day be filled with the same warmth and grace that you bestow upon others. https://t.co/wTd2EdS1DG. The fact the Trump administration tried to end federal support for coronavirus testing sites<U+0097>just as many states across our nation are about to reach their peak<U+0097>shows their staggering incompetence. 
https://t.co/GYdETAiIGo. Thank you, @Diddy, for hosting this town hall last night. There's a lot at stake for our communities right now and it's critical we bring to the forefront how coronavirus is perpetuating racial inequality and health disparities.
https://t.co/mPFYcIhsFD. I<U+0092>ve fought for consumers all my life:
<U+0097>Took on big banks committing credit-debt collection abuses, resulting in $50M in restitutions
<U+0097>Secured $20B for CA homeowners during the foreclosure crisis
<U+0097>Won $1.1B against Corinthian Colleges

I'll continue that fight during this crisis.. Wanted to make sure you saw this powerful message of hope and encouragement from @GabbyGiffords. 

<U+0093>I know the power of Americans standing together <U+0097> not just to endure this, but to emerge from it stronger.<U+0094>
https://t.co/lk4EBPaz7Z. If the word icon ever meant anything it certainly applies to Phyllis Lyon. Phyllis and her partner Del Martin were true pioneers in the fight for lesbian and LGBTQ+ rights. I'm honored to have called them my friends. Their contributions will never be forgotten.. Nearly 40% of Americans don't have enough cash to cover a $400 unexpected expense. A one time check won't cut it.

Americans deserve reoccurring monthly payments to reduce the burden of this crisis. 
https://t.co/6XBC7NbODu. This virus is a predator. It preys on people with pre-existing health conditions. But we can't ignore the underlying reasons why people<U+0097>especially people of color<U+0097>have these pre-existing health conditions in the first place. #KingLectureSeries https://t.co/hV08FJJaX1. LIVE: Tune in as I join @DonnaBrazile for @HowardU's #KingLectureSeries to discuss coronavirus and how it's affecting African American communities across our nation <U+2192> https://t.co/zpTUeUZ6vd. Black mayors across our nation continue to speak truth to power about the disproportionate impact coronavirus is having on our communities.
https://t.co/hZl4Ecoi6O. Families are in pain right now, forced to make nearly impossible decisions in order to keep a roof over their head. 

To help ease the burden, I<U+0092>m calling for a suspension of credit card interest, fees, and penalties until after the pandemic is over. 
https://t.co/UQItjm46nV. The latest unemployment numbers are out and they are absolutely staggering<U+0097>another 6.6 million Americans filed claims last week. This is exactly why I called for a freeze on credit card interest fees and penalties. Bills don't stop just because we're in the middle of a pandemic.. We must act swiftly to decrease the number of immigrant detainees and implement alternatives to detention. With some immigrants and staff starting to show symptoms of coronavirus, this is a humanitarian crisis on the brink of exploding.
https://t.co/GSF8SaXEMT. .@LaurenePowell is right. It would be disastrous for the Supreme Court to end DACA in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. 

Congress must ensure access to testing and treatment for immigrants, many of whom are on the front lines of this crisis.
https://t.co/ynm7rTLMMP. Wishing you and yours a happy Passover. Whether you<U+0092>re celebrating over video chat or in person with those you<U+0092>re staying at home with, let us all use this moment to remember that hope can be renewed even in the darkest of times.. Today I announced I'm calling for the suspension of credit card interest fees and penalties until this pandemic is over. Folks need relief and they need it now. https://t.co/IuBHrM0T9v. .@BernieSanders is an extraordinary leader. From health care to climate change, his campaign drove the conversation around what's in the best interests of working families. We must continue that spirit and ethos as we work to unite the party to defeat Trump.. TUNE IN: About to virtually join @TheView at 11 a.m. ET to discuss the coronavirus crisis and what Congress can do to further help laid-off workers, communities, and struggling families who aren<U+0092>t sure how they<U+0092>ll make ends meet.. Tonight I<U+0092>ll be on @LateNightSeth to discuss Congress<U+0092> coronavirus efforts and what we can do to help families and small businesses get through this crisis. Be sure to tune in at 12:35 a.m. ET.. On top of work stress, many immigrant doctors fighting coronavirus also face the added burden of visa uncertainty. It shouldn<U+0092>t have to be this way<U+0097>all health care workers must be able to maintain their immigration status.
https://t.co/j2v9MMZI3v. This afternoon I chatted with @OneFairWage about what actions Congress and the White House must take next to support working families who are struggling to get through the month. Help can't wait. https://t.co/DilhZuFTdi. Black communities disproportionately suffer from pre-existing conditions, increasing coronavirus risk.

20% more likely to have asthma.
40% more likely to have high blood pressure.
Black women are 3x more likely to have lupus.

Racial justice is at the forefront of this crisis.. This crisis has drastically hit gig and underpaid contract workers. Chip in now to the @theworkerslab<U+0092> Workers Fund to help some of our most vulnerable workers who have lost their source of income. Every dollar makes a difference.
https://t.co/csRORCNGBe. It doesn<U+0092>t have to be this way. Trump needs to stop sitting on his hands and listen to our front line workers. Time to fully invoke the Defense Production Act, get these heroes the supplies they desperately need, and show some moral leadership for once.
https://t.co/n5ONBiGipJ. It breaks my heart that for some, stay-at-home orders mean being home with their abuser. 

If you do not feel safe or need help, @RAINN's hotline is available all hours of the day at 1-800-656-4673 or online at https://t.co/Wc9H72vy6h.
https://t.co/3a104ObTib. Again and again during his rallies, Trump posed this question to Black voters: ""What do you have to lose?""

The answer is clear: our lives.
https://t.co/AHENNO4eKc. No one should ever have to choose between protecting their health and exercising their constitutional right to vote. https://t.co/oylmFaY5Rg. Nearly 3 million students nationwide don<U+0092>t have access to the internet at home. Some use phones to type papers, switching back and forth between a search engine and their essay. Others rely on public wifi.

Congress must address broadband in poor and rural communities.. This week and next week will be difficult for all of us. Let<U+0092>s support and lift up our family, friends, and community in every way that we can. Take care of each other.. Trump punishes those who aren<U+0092>t loyal to him.

He<U+0092>s blatantly hostile to any sign of accountability. 

But as IG Michael Atkinson said, <U+0093>Do not allow recent events to silence your voices.<U+0094>  

Now, more than ever, we must speak truth and push back against this lawless president. https://t.co/nwtOUx4Dn1. Thankful for our nation<U+0092>s brave nurses who are day in and day out risking their own lives to help save coronavirus patients. We see you and we<U+0092>re fighting to ensure you have the personal protective equipment needed to safely do your jobs. 
https://t.co/34HbmbIG8z. During a pandemic, the Trump administration announced they were changing rules that would worsen air and water pollution. It's outrageous.

We should be working to reduce coronavirus risk, not exacerbating underlying conditions. I've called on the EPA to halt these rules.. Even before this pandemic, two-thirds of low-income workers did not have paid sick leave.

Nearly half of Americans were a $400 unexpected expense away from financial hardship.

A one-time check won<U+0092>t cut it. I<U+0092>m staying in D.C. fighting for monthly cash payments and paid leave.. @Astrid_NV Astrid, thank you for the work you've done and continue to do. Your work does not go unnoticed. Passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do and we won't stop fighting until Dreamers and their families have a path to citizenship.. Thank you @marceelias for highlighting the pressing issue in front of us.

Election Day is 211 days away.

All states must start taking action now to ensure every voice is heard. https://t.co/IAa8lC78Rh. We cannot ignore the disparities that exist when it comes to the coronavirus. For many, staying at home is a privilege. 
https://t.co/Ctb1XC3yLI. Grateful Californians are leading the way and staying home if they<U+0092>re able. Keep it up. We all need to do what we can to flatten the curve. 
https://t.co/5GPqCzdHsX. Over 50 days ago I called for public hearings so Americans could hear directly from current Trump admin officials about the coronavirus.

Trump knew the severity of the situation about 90 days ago<U+0097>and failed to swiftly act.

More Americans are dying due to his incompetence. https://t.co/1CfZX57ttb. As I said on #RolandMartinUnfiltered this week, this virus is predatory. It preys on people with pre-existing conditions, and as we're learning, it's hitting our Black communities hard. I'm in D.C. focused on getting the resources needed to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/m5Z51n2tJY. If you<U+0092>re able, take a moment this weekend to call a friend you haven<U+0092>t talked to in a while. Send a message to your grandparents. At times like these we need to make sure we<U+0092>re social distancing, but not emotional distancing.. It<U+0092>s been 52 years since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. His tragic death came at a time when he was in full swing pushing for economic and racial justice for workers.

Let<U+0092>s honor his legacy by continuing his fight for safe working conditions and a living wage.. Coronavirus is further shedding light on racial disparities that already existed in our nation.

This alarming new report is exactly why I joined my colleagues this week calling on the HHS to collect racial and ethnic data for coronavirus patients.
https://t.co/x0jOCr3Z8G. The hero of this crisis is not the president of the United States, but the health care workers who are working each and every day to save lives. https://t.co/7Pip4eVjQB. This week, I announced a resolution with my colleagues condemning the hateful attacks against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants. We must stand together with our sisters, brothers, and friends.
https://t.co/cMVmBIO5ck. Health care workers are on the front lines taking care of us<U+0097>we need to be there for them.

That<U+0092>s why the last bill we passed includes funding to help workers pay for child care. But we must do more to support them. 
https://t.co/QlQsZqlnPB. The world lost a legend. Soul singer Bill Withers' song Grandma's Hands is one of my favorites and reminds me of my grandmother and so many other mother-figures in my life. 

Let's all continue to live by his cherished lyrics during these times and lean on each other.. Tune in this morning to @steveharveyfm at 7:15 a.m. ET where I'll discuss the coronavirus crisis, its disproportionate impact on communities of color, and what actions Congress needs to take next to help struggling Americans.. Fifty days ago I attended a Homeland Security committee meeting about the coronavirus<U+0097>and no current Trump administration public health officials bothered to show up.

Now more than 5,000 Americans are dead. Their failure to swiftly act cost lives.. Read this and share with your friends and family. Our government has repeatedly failed Native and Indigenous communities. We can<U+0092>t let that continue in the middle of a pandemic.
https://t.co/8VFasHPcWb. Across our nation, Black women mayors like California's @LondonBreed and @AjaLBrown are stepping up and taking coronavirus seriously even when this administration didn't. Thank you for leading the way. #BlackWomenLead. We<U+0092>re facing an unprecedented crisis and real leadership is needed now more than ever. Take @VictoryInst<U+0092>s National #OutToWin Day pledge to run at https://t.co/TJJzjiDPVE. https://t.co/CBvFiVcFHD. This isn't enough. At a time when we are seeing a severe blood shortage in our country, we must allow all healthy Americans to donate, including gay and bisexual men.

The FDA must fully end its discriminatory policy.
https://t.co/DIfrnSwxYH. 6.6 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, the highest number of claims in history. McConnell, we must get back to work now to pass monthly cash payments, suspend negative credit reporting, and do more to help the millions of Americans who are hurting.. This pandemic has exacerbated the health, education, and economic disparities that have disproportionately impacted communities of color for centuries. They must be addressed in the next bill. https://t.co/pstmMusuHY. The Trump administration turning their back on uninsured Americans in the middle of a pandemic is completely indefensible.

But know this: some states, including California, have reopened enrollment. Check with your state for more information and demand they reopen enrollment. https://t.co/gIfxnQ5s3r. Social distancing is important, not emotional distancing. Call your loved ones, talk to your single friends, or catch up on the Tiger King.<U+00A0>(And yes, I<U+0092>m a cosponsor of the Big Cat Public Safety Act!) https://t.co/jVWBgXdzhw. Trump's response to this crisis has been woefully inadequate. Real leadership means you have the courage to speak truth<U+0097>something Trump knows nothing about. https://t.co/9vN5SEeCCO. Grateful for California<U+0092>s leadership on this issue. States must follow to ensure the safety of incarcerated individuals and prevent the spread of this deadly disease. 

Take action to Stop the Spread: https://t.co/sAanSPvO7k https://t.co/QknIrnX5ie. .@EdwardTedJames, you have always been a fighter and I know you are going to use that same fight to beat coronavirus. Louisiana needs you in the critical work ahead. Doug and I are sending you prayers for a swift recovery. https://t.co/BB7nsc6HIv. Trump and his administration failed to take coronavirus seriously from the start.

They ignored intelligence warnings.
Didn<U+0092>t start immediate testing.
Took weeks to utilize the Defense Production Act. 

Now 100,000 to 250,000 Americans are projected to die.. Every day the Treasury Department delays getting Americans their ~$1,200 cash payments is another day people are petrified they<U+0092>ll be evicted. 

It<U+0092>s another day spent crunching the numbers to see if they can feed their babies and pay the bills. 

Waiting is not an option.. On #CesarChavezDay, we remember the renowned labor leader who fought for the people who put food on our table. He organized to improve farm worker conditions through @UFWupdates &amp; helped catalyze the Latino civil rights movement in our nation. Forever grateful for his leadership.. This morning I joined @jess_mc and @ZerlinaMaxwell on @signalboostshow to discuss what steps Congress needs to take to help the 3.3 million Americans who are unemployed and those who are struggling. First up? Monthly cash payments.

Full episode here: https://t.co/rYd19FE4So https://t.co/d2NgJb2OT2. Don<U+0092>t let this go unnoticed: in the middle of this pandemic Trump<U+0092>s trying to slip through a judge who supports the <U+0093>complete and immediate<U+0094> reversal of Roe v. Wade.
https://t.co/h2JLk20x7K. Women are still paid on average 80 cents on the dollar.
Black women 61 cents.
Native American women 58 cents. 
Latinas 53 cents. 

This #EqualPayDay, our fight is far from over. It<U+0092>s past time all of our daughters grew up knowing their work is worth just as much as our sons.. During this crisis, service workers and gig workers have been hit hard and we cannot allow them to fall through the cracks. If you can, please donate to @onefairwage<U+0092>s emergency fund, which directly helps those workers struggling to make ends meet: https://t.co/rll3sHHTlP https://t.co/8n8WLyPKs3. No one deserves to live their life in fear because of who they are. But we cannot ignore the reality of how dangerous it is to be transgender in our country<U+0097>especially for trans women of color. We can<U+0092>t stop fighting for equality. #TransDayofVisibility. An Asian American father and his 2-year-old and 6-year-old were stabbed because the perpetrator thought they were Chinese and had coronavirus.

Donald Trump has put the lives of Asian Americans and Asian immigrants at risk.
https://t.co/XD3dnFjVtK. These children didn<U+0092>t belong in detention in the first place. They need to be released to family or guardians immediately. To do anything less would fail a critical moral test. 
https://t.co/CkFWWmgJXn. Thinking about our children keeps me up at night. Even before this pandemic began, disparities in our education system already existed<U+0097>we can<U+0092>t let them fall behind during this crisis. https://t.co/uX5c5gbNIr. .@Yamiche, thank you for speaking truth to power and asking the questions Americans deserve answers to. Keep pressing on. https://t.co/9gQR9ZcVHJ. Companies that put their workers at risk during a pandemic put all our lives at risk. I support Instacart workers as they strike today for safer working conditions and better protections. 
https://t.co/jerEYj5JOJ. Thankful for our medical professionals on the front lines who are risking their personal health and safety to save others. 

This #NationalDoctorsDay, if you can, stay home<U+0097>for them.. Rent is coming up at the end of the month. Bills need to be paid. What we passed last week was a start but it's not enough for hurting Americans. https://t.co/cLGNAfgpIl. I<U+0092>ve been thinking about this moment from the campaign a lot these past few weeks. Nearly one third of rural Americans don<U+0092>t have access to high-speed internet. Congress investing in affordable broadband services is more important than ever. 
https://t.co/t7lf748crj. <U+2705>Monthly cash payments
<U+2705>Paid family and sick leave
<U+2705>Bans on all evictions and foreclosures

We can<U+0097>and must<U+0097>do more to directly help Americans during this crisis.. Many service workers already living paycheck to paycheck are facing layoffs or uncertainty about how they<U+0092>ll make ends meet. If you<U+0092>re able to, please chip in to @UniteHere to help service workers across our country directly affected by the pandemic.
https://t.co/BjV0nEOy73. Excited to join other Black women leaders at @HigherHeights<U+0092> #SundayBrunch at 2 p.m. ET today to discuss the coronavirus and its impact on Black women, our families, and our communities. Join this important conversation here: https://t.co/Sdut0w69F8. For weeks the Trump administration has pushed racist and xenophobic rhetoric against Asian Americans. As San Francisco<U+0092>s DA, I created a hate crimes unit because I know the damage words can cause. We must be clear: any attacks against Asian Americans are attacks on us all. https://t.co/DJmImnjvpU. If you<U+0092>re on the road delivering essential supplies, finishing up your shift at the hospital, or staying home<U+0097>thank you. https://t.co/349LbUlMSy. Keeping the national parks in California open during a pandemic is endangering people<U+0092>s lives. I sent a letter to the Secretary of the @Interior and the @NatlParkService calling for their closure. We need leadership.
https://t.co/tZr0I22jMl. A civil rights icon left us last night. Reverend Joseph Lowery dedicated his life to fighting for justice and inclusion, serving others to create a better world. Sending my condolences to the Lowery family. His legacy will continue to live on in the lives of those he touched. https://t.co/U9nKsc6kCM. Unconscionable. We<U+0092>re in the middle of a public health crisis and the Trump administration is giving companies the power to pollute our air and water just so they can save a couple bucks.
https://t.co/R7cYxiVNjR. #WhileAtHome is a resource hub for information about coronavirus and actions you can take to stay engaged during this time. Check it out<U+2192> https://t.co/K1AtV2uoqD. There are 700K DACA recipients whose uncertainty about the future has multiplied because of this pandemic.

Ending DACA during this unprecedented crisis would be disastrous and cruel. I support a request filed at the Supreme Court today urging them not to issue a ruling now.. The hotel, travel, and food industries have been severely hit by this crisis, making the future uncertain for many workers of color. I<U+0092>m fighting for expanded unemployment benefits and paid sick leave to ensure the burden of this pandemic isn<U+0092>t felt for generations. https://t.co/aca6vtM6A4. The House just passed the coronavirus bill, giving some relief to hospitals, small businesses &amp; struggling Americans. But it<U+0092>s not enough. I won<U+0092>t stop fighting until we get paid sick &amp; family leave, extended food assistance &amp; further help for those hardest hit by this crisis.. Trump has the power to use the Defense Production Act to order the production of more masks and ventilators.

He says, <U+0093>we don<U+0092>t need it.<U+0094>

Tell that to the nurses and doctors reusing masks.
Tell that to the patient who needs a ventilator but can't get one.

We need it.. Couldn't let the day pass by without wishing a happy birthday to my fellow Californian and our fearless leader, @SpeakerPelosi. Thank you for holding this administration accountable at every turn and tirelessly working for the people. I<U+0092>m glad to be by your side in this fight.. No matter the distance, your sisters are always there. Sending strength to my Soror as you continue this fight! @akasorority1908
https://t.co/ZhpLDQsjlk. Yesterday's passed bill is a critical first step for those who need our help:
<U+0097>Cash payments up to $1,200 for many Americans &amp; $500 for children
<U+0097>Expanded unemployment insurance
<U+0097>$150B for states, tribes &amp; localities
<U+0097>$377B for small business relief
<U+0097>Over $100B for our hospitals. The Trump administration was given a step-by-step guide of what to do during a pandemic<U+0097>they ignored it. Coronavirus has killed more than 1,000 Americans already.  
https://t.co/mg0rrpit1A. Asian Americans who face hate crimes, discrimination, or xenophobic attacks deserve a safe place to report to. Other state attorneys general should do the same.
https://t.co/VXI3fPIT9n. Nearly 3.3 million people are out of work. Hospitals are overflowing. And things will only get worse before they get better. 

Our job isn't over.. Teachers, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you. You<U+0092>ve had to adapt to an entirely new system of teaching practically overnight. But day after day you are there for your kids. You show up for them and we need to show up for you.
https://t.co/6iB4ZslxSf. During times of crisis, students with disabilities deserve certainty they won<U+0092>t be left behind. 

Betsy DeVos is failing that test. 
https://t.co/AI3GyCll6m. The November elections will be one of the most consequential in our lifetime. Everything from health care to ending gun violence is on the ballot.<U+00A0>

Additional funding is a good start, but Congress can<U+0097>and must<U+0097>do more to ensure your vote is protected and our elections are safe. https://t.co/Zsk9QXTHYo. @WillDubbs Will, our beloved Iowa leader of #TeamKamala, we<U+0092>re sending you best wishes for a speedy recovery. We love you and I need you in the fights ahead.<U+00A0>The entire team is sending you strength and love to beat this.. Our service workers have been some of the hardest hit in this crisis, many already living paycheck to paycheck. If you can, please consider supporting @UniteHere during this time. It will make a huge difference in the lives of tens of thousands of workers: https://t.co/Pi0ltBIj55 https://t.co/k81Tcm4EOY. It goes without saying: Trump and his administration shouldn<U+0092>t be able to use a pandemic to line their own pockets. 
https://t.co/u1X51izUWW. The U.S. surpassed 50,000 confirmed coronavirus cases today.

We<U+0092>re on track to pass Italy and China within a week.

Leadership is putting American lives before Wall Street profits.
https://t.co/MXblEk75rp. Tribal health services were already underfunded before this pandemic began. Republicans continue to fight to give tribes less than what they deserve and need in the latest coronavirus relief bill. 

Investments for tribal and native communities must be made a priority.. Black women in America are dying at a rate 3-4x higher than white women from pregnancy-related causes. 

In our health care system, a Black mother<U+0092>s pain isn<U+0092>t always listened to or taken seriously, and for some, not having an advocate by their side could prove to be fatal. https://t.co/1W3bZ4KdUq. Americans are afraid of what the future holds. Emergency cash, money for small businesses, and suspending penalties for missed payments are three ways we can help give hardworking Americans some relief during this crisis. 
https://t.co/2uWvDpxixa. Republicans in Texas and Ohio are using a global pandemic to control women<U+0092>s bodies. It<U+0092>s utterly despicable.
https://t.co/A77elY80DL. Right now millions of Americans are waking up in the middle of the night, worried sick they<U+0092>ll lose the roof over their head as a result of this crisis. 

Congress must ban evictions, foreclosures, and repossessions until this pandemic is over.. The Affordable Care Act was signed into law 10 years ago. Trump wants to terminate it. If successful:

<U+274C>20M people would lose health insurance
<U+274C>No pre-existing condition protections
<U+274C>Higher prescription drug costs for seniors

Trump is the biggest threat to our health care.. @amyklobuchar Amy, I am so sorry to hear about this. Doug and I are sending prayers to John, you, and the rest of your family during this difficult time.. McConnell's bill yesterday would hand corporations fistfuls of money without requiring them to protect their workers or keep people employed. 

It's this simple: we need to put #PeopleOverProfits.. Outrageous. We are in the middle of a global pandemic and Donald Trump wants to strip health care from millions of Americans. This is why we fight. https://t.co/EYs0eX3tDo. Coronavirus has upended daily life for millions of Americans. Many won<U+0092>t make ends meet at the end of this month. Instead, this bill gives the Trump administration authority to hand out $500B to corporations without any real protection for workers. I will vote no.. Across the country people have come together to give to the @DomesticWorkers Coronavirus Care Fund<U+0097>a fund that directly helps domestic workers and caregivers during this difficult time. If you<U+0092>re able to, join us by chipping in now<U+2192> https://t.co/O7V9iUoDLw https://t.co/bJ52HeGmCr. No better way to spend a Saturday night with Doug than at #ClubQuarantine. Thank you @djdnice for bringing the world together. https://t.co/3L0noumxUn. I applaud @MarilynMosbyEsq for taking action to reduce the threat of coronavirus for those behind bars. Let's do it nationwide. 

This week I sent a letter to the Bureau of Prisons pushing them to release low-risk prisoners, including those detained because they can<U+0092>t make bail. https://t.co/SVPCrxgTq5. Currently FEMA can only provide individuals assistance during natural disasters<U+0097>not pandemics.

I introduced a bill this week to change that, immediately opening up money, unemployment benefits, nutrition assistance, and more. Americans need help and they need it now.. The government must be prepared for the possibility of a natural disaster coinciding with this pandemic instead of waiting for it to bang down the door. The stakes are too high.
https://t.co/BdmeFGyDeJ. As states shift their elections last minute because of this pandemic, the folks at @votedotorg have you covered. Find the latest information on how to make your voice heard in the age of coronavirus. 
https://t.co/upEaXr4icA. Brittany, thank you for being open and honest about the toll this pandemic is having on your mental health. There are so many people out there right now who are facing the same challenges. #AllInThisTogether

Learn more and schedule an appointment today: https://t.co/RBvt0pady6.. Yesterday I announced I<U+0092>m calling for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to release low-risk incarcerated individuals. Not only will it help keep those vulnerable safer from coronavirus, it<U+0092>s the right thing to do.. Grateful for Governor @GavinNewsom<U+0092>s leadership to protect Californians and flatten the curve. Learn what this means for you at https://t.co/O6OszPsg7d.
https://t.co/iWrC1ZIdnI. For many domestic violence survivors, including children, staying at home could heighten their risk of abuse. 

If you or someone you know needs help, @RAINN<U+0092>s hotline is available 24/7 at 1-800-656-4673 or online at https://t.co/Wc9H72vy6h.. This is a time to dig deep in ourselves to remember that in moments of crisis, some of the greatest heroes are those who show love, kindness, and patience.

That<U+0092>s how we<U+0092>ll get through this<U+0097>together.. <U+274C>Failure to meet early requests from states for equipment and help.
<U+274C>Not looping federal agencies in at the beginning of the crisis.
<U+274C>Sending masks to states beyond their expiration date.

We need leadership that provides transparency and takes responsibility in a crisis. https://t.co/Mgdv6VempW. Incredibly grateful for the farm workers and grocery store workers across our nation who are risking their own health to keep food on our tables during this pandemic. We owe them a debt of gratitude, including better pay and protections.
https://t.co/YYWr5LS3hn. Deborah is over 60 years old and works as a janitor. The building she was cleaning had a confirmed case of coronavirus<U+0097>but no one told her of the potential exposure. <U+0093>I felt as if I didn<U+0092>t matter.<U+0094> 

It's unconscionable. Workers must be protected.
https://t.co/2tlGdHAlIe. This is Jennifer Haller, mother to two teenagers and the first volunteer to receive the experimental coronavirus vaccine this week. A true hero. 
https://t.co/drzFxC3gIm. We need leadership, not racist dog whistles that endanger Asian Americans and further divide us. 
https://t.co/N5Jzdclxys. It is in everyone's interest<U+0097>and everyone's safety<U+0097>to make sure that workers have paid sick leave. Congress must act.. @KimFoxxforSA Congratulations! I know you'll continue to fight for bold, historical change in our criminal justice system every day of your campaign. Onward to November.. Our nation<U+0092>s domestic workers and caregivers do physically demanding and important work, often without paid sick leave. Chip in what you can today to the @domesticworkers Coronavirus Care Fund: https://t.co/IGWM7durqe https://t.co/aT5h6zuton. Americans can<U+0092>t wait. The Senate must pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act now.
https://t.co/34bNjVyXb9. If you are healthy and able to, please check in on your elderly neighbors or family members. Help buy some groceries. Give them a call to brighten their day. Isolation can lead to depression, which is why it<U+0092>s critical we help feed their souls any way we can.. Filling out the census online is quick, easy, and convenient. Do your part to make sure your community gets counted. 
https://t.co/bYijCndaOQ. Domestic workers and caregivers are on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. Many of them are women or people of color who do not have basic protections like paid sick days. Congress must make sure they<U+0092>re supported during this difficult time.
https://t.co/4w9zaCiGfk. With more people staying home to stem this crisis, shutting off water, electricity, internet, and phone services for those who can<U+0092>t pay their bills could have devastating consequences. That's why I<U+0092>m calling on companies to end shutoffs and I thank those that have already acted.. To all our nation<U+0092>s health care workers and first responders: thank you. We are forever grateful for your hard work and sacrifice.. Before this crisis, nearly half of Americans were a $400 unexpected expense away from financial hardship. That<U+0092>s why I introduced the LIFT Act to give up to $6,000/yr to middle-class families.

Congress must act with emergency cash to help families and the economy now.. There is no question this pandemic is stretching our health care system and our economy, but it<U+0092>s critically important we all do our part now to slow the spread of the virus. If you are able to, please stay home. 
https://t.co/RJOzSVb9u2. Across CA, 4.7M adults and 2M children live in food-insecure households. It<U+0092>s more important than ever that we support our food banks and those who feed our neighbors and children. Donate to a food bank near you: https://t.co/BjBbs1GHkl.. What is the Bureau of Prisons doing to protect vulnerable incarcerated individuals and staff from coronavirus? My colleagues and I are demanding answers.
https://t.co/ILcXHtiq5w. If you haven<U+0092>t already, now is the time to check up on your elderly neighbors or those who may not be able to venture outside at this time. See if they need groceries. Offer to help run errands. 

We need to be there for each other.. McConnell must immediately call the Senate back in session to vote on the House-passed coronavirus relief package. Families can<U+0092>t wait.. Census questionnaires began arriving yesterday. Here<U+0092>s what you need to know to make sure you and your family are counted. 
https://t.co/c7BSLitx3g. This could lead to sick people going into work for fear of losing eligibility. An absolutely heartless move that must be reversed. 
https://t.co/w1ph2rElKQ. We<U+0092>re in the middle of a public health crisis and it<U+0092>s critical we all take it seriously. 

<U+0097>Wash your hands with soap and water as often as you can. 
<U+0097>Keep a safe social distance from people. 

If we<U+0092>re going to slow down this virus, it<U+0092>s going to take all of us doing our part.. None should have to choose between staying home while sick or being able to afford to feed their babies and keep a roof over their head. 

Yet two-thirds of low-income workers do not have paid sick leave.

Paid sick leave makes everyone safer. We must guarantee it now.. As colleges and universities across our nation make changes due to the coronavirus, it<U+0092>s critical that we think about how this will affect low-income students. 
https://t.co/Mn5UVRG2DM. Here's the bottom line: paid sick leave will save lives. Congress must make it a reality immediately.. This is outrageous. We are in the midst of a pandemic and Senate Republicans blocked paid sick leave for those affected by the coronavirus. 

Congress must take action immediately to help working families. 
https://t.co/hA50TV2nZI. Today marks the 5 years since I launched Back on Track LA as CA<U+0092>s Attorney General, a program designed to give young people in our criminal justice system a second chance with job training and support. 

We need more initiatives like this to reform our criminal justice system.. I know today may be tough for some survivors of sexual assault. Know that we hear you, we see you, and we won't let you be ignored. If you or anyone you know needs support, please contact @RAINN's hotline at 1 (800) 656-4673.. The US has one of the highest maternal death rates in the developed world<U+0097>and that rate is significantly worse for Black women.

I introduced the Black Maternal Health Momnibus with members of the Black Maternal Health Caucus to address this serious issue.
https://t.co/AFQ4oHnFIV. Together we can make $15 the national minimum wage.
Together we can ensure health care is a right.
Together we can tackle climate change.
Together we can defeat Donald Trump.

We will do this<U+0097>together.. On National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, know that it is within our capacity to end HIV and AIDS within a generation. And I will fight every day to make that a reality.. My advice to young women everywhere this #WomensHistoryMonth: choose friends that will be your sisters for life, who will encourage you to be your best self, and stand by you through the ups and downs. Then hold those relationships close. 
https://t.co/7uJpc6YT6X. On Harriet Tubman Day, we pay tribute to the hero who escaped slavery in her twenties, only to return many times to lead hundreds of slaves to freedom. 

It<U+0092>s outrageous the Trump administration is obstructing her from being on the $20 bill.. As the former co-founder of my high school dance group <U+0093>Midnight Magic,<U+0094> I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Western High School<U+0092>s Dance Team from Baltimore, MD yesterday. Keep on dancing. https://t.co/LYbtOskLnG. Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and Washington: justice is on the ballot in 2020<U+0097>and @JoeBiden is on the ballot today. Get out and vote. https://t.co/XMjpqT0CNU. Wait, what? Jonathan, we need to talk.

House Party was directed by my dear friend @reghud and was released 30 years ago today. We have to get you up to speed. https://t.co/M1SxsF4fTK. Trump has abandoned America<U+0092>s global leadership in combating climate change, but we can<U+0092>t give up the fight. This is the challenge of our time.. America cannot fulfill its great promise until every American<U+0097>regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, race, or religion<U+0097>can grow up knowing that their rights and opportunities will never be limited because of their identity.. This morning, I announced I<U+0092>m endorsing Joe Biden for president because we need someone who reflects the decency and dignity of the American people and who fights for those whose voices are too often ignored. https://t.co/H7AgCoTwd6. As my mother always used to say, <U+0093>you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you are not the last.<U+0094>

On #InternationalWomensDay, let<U+0092>s recognize the sacrifices of all the extraordinary women who came before us and continue their fight for equality and representation.. .@JoeBiden has served our country with dignity and we need him now more than ever. I will do everything in my power to help elect him the next President of the United States. https://t.co/DbB2fGWpaa. From the suffragettes to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., people have organized, fought, and marched to move us toward a more just and inclusive nation. It<U+0092>s incumbent on us to keep up their fight.. 55 years ago today, peaceful protestors attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, marching for voting rights. They were unjustly beaten by state troopers<U+0097>but they were not deterred.

We stand on the shoulders of these heroes and their courage to fight for a better nation.. On March 6, 2017, Trump enacted his Travel Ban 2.0. To this day he continues to expand his ban that discriminates against Muslims and immigrants of color, and undermines our nation<U+0092>s core values.

Let<U+0092>s be clear: we will continue to fight it.. 2020 is going to be one of the most consequential elections of our lifetimes. 

The future of the Supreme Court. 
The gun violence epidemic. 
The global crisis that is climate change.

All of these issues and more are on the ballot.
https://t.co/JhnnWoqVUD. California is home to many firsts, including:

-The first woman Speaker of the House of Representatives
-The first state to have two women serve together in the U.S. Senate

Our democracy works best when women are at the table, and Californians know that. #WomensHistoryMonth. Even when things get tough, we must continue to have courage, speak truth, and fight for what we know is right.. Since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, the right to vote in our country has been under attack. And voters of color are overwhelmingly being targeted.

We have to fight back, and https://t.co/KBdSSDZsbj is a critical resource to help us do just that.. Well before we were elected to Congress, @ewarren and I took on the big banks together during the foreclosure crisis. I knew then what remains clear to this day: she is an incredible leader, a fighter, and a dear friend. I have nothing but praise for her.

Thank you, Elizabeth.. My friend @ToddGloria will be a fearless leader for the people of San Diego and is the clear choice to be the next Mayor. I'm thrilled he'll be on the ballot in November. https://t.co/aN8VGHhgxR. Polls close in 20 minutes in California. If you are still in line to vote, stay there.

You<U+0092>re allowed to vote as long as you<U+0092>re in line by 8 p.m.<U+0097>no matter how long it takes.. If you live in...

...You can vote in the primary today. Go to https://t.co/MykJL0X5gt to learn more. #SuperTuesday. Californians: it<U+0092>s #SuperTuesday and polls are open until 8:00 p.m. 

Did you do a vote-by-mail ballot? Your ballot must be postmarked by today<U+0097>or returned in-person to a polling place or dropped into one of your county<U+0092>s ballot drop boxes.

Make sure your vote is counted.. A reminder for Californians: Polls are open tomorrow from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. 

If you haven<U+0092>t already registered to vote yet, you still have the opportunity to cast your ballot. California offers conditional voter registration through Election Day.. Watch this video by @YelloPain. His message gets to heart of what's at stake in November.

If we want to raise the minimum wage, address the climate crisis, reform our criminal justice system and so much more, then we need to elect Democrats to Congress and flip the Senate. https://t.co/GugsoNsO1X. I know @ToddGloria will be a fearless and outspoken leader for the people of San Diego. It was wonderful to join him over the weekend to help get out the vote-there's no doubt in my mind that he's the clear choice to be the next Mayor of San Diego. https://t.co/FJbJYcePMG. Throughout this campaign, @amyklobuchar brought passion, humor, and an unceasing dedication to working Americans. She's as tough as they come, and I'll miss her presence in the race.. For me, Howard is home, the family that you chose. For generations, students at Howard have been supported and inspired to forge the way forward for our country and our world. Happy Charter Day, @HowardU! https://t.co/eedWbihubO. My friend @TomSteyer ran this race knowing that the climate crisis is an existential threat to our nation, especially in the face of a president who calls it a hoax. 

His voice will be missed from this race. Thank you, Tom. https://t.co/fHRIK4xgHh. During my time on the trail, Doug and I shared many conversations with @PeteButtigieg &amp; @Chas10Buttigieg. I know that our visions for America both stem from a deep love of country, commitment to unity &amp; belief that no one should fight alone.

Grateful for your historic run, Pete.. The only way we are going to tackle gun violence, the climate crisis &amp; any other issue is with a Senate that reflects our values as a country.

This year we must work harder than ever before to usher in new leaders that will work for us on issues that impact our everyday lives.. My mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was the greatest source of inspiration in my life. She taught my sister Maya and me the importance of hard work and to believe in our power to right what is wrong. There<U+0092>s no one I<U+0092>d rather honor this first day of #WomensHistoryMonth. https://t.co/SELsre9zBQ. In 2009, the federal minimum wage was set at $7.25/hour.

More than 10 years later and it<U+0092>s still $7.25. We need a $15 minimum wage to be the national floor. Now.. Today marks the last day of #BlackHistoryMonth. I wanted to take a moment to recognize those young leaders who have yet to make history<U+0097>but will one day. Keep writing your story.. .@DennisNia is ending #BlackHistoryMonth the right way-by showcasing her Black excellence. Beyonc<e9> herself would be proud. https://t.co/XL1diN2u4W. A huge victory for almost 12,000 workers in Santa Clara, CA. This would not be possible without the tireless leadership of Riko Mendez and the @SEIU521 members who are on the front lines every day fighting to ensure fair pay and dignity for every worker.  https://t.co/7NrLvlt1Vr. If we<U+0092>re going to combat homophobia and transphobia in this country, we must pass the Equality Act to increase protections for LGBTQ+ Americans across the country. It<U+0092>s on us to prove that no one will be left to fight alone.. Everyone takes pride in going to the polls on Election Day and getting their I Voted sticker.

But let me remind you<U+0097>many states like California offer alternative ways to cast your ballot, such as vote-by-mail or early voting. Be sure to check with your state's election office.. Shirley Chisholm had the guts to oppose the Vietnam War. The guts to run for president in 1972. And she had the guts to speak truth<U+0097>no matter how uncomfortable or unpopular. Our nation<U+0092>s leaders could all use a little more of Shirley Chisholm<U+0092>s grit and grace. #BlackHistoryMonth. This video is horrifying and incredibly tough to listen to. But it<U+0092>s important we listen<U+0097>because too many of our children are treated this way. 

It<U+0092>s time we stop the treatment of children as adults in our criminal justice system. 
https://t.co/fDDo2qGD7D. Devastated by the news coming out of Milwaukee. My heart goes out to their entire community, the first responders on the scene, and the victims<U+0092> families.

No matter where you are, you deserve to feel safe from gun violence. When will enough finally be enough? https://t.co/we6Mxv3Vds. We must speak truth: lynchings were horrific, racist acts of violence used as an instrument of terror and oppression. I applaud the House for voting today to make lynching a federal crime<U+0097>we must swiftly bring it to the Senate floor. Justice for victims is long overdue.. Americans deserve transparency about what the administration is doing to confront the coronavirus.
https://t.co/E5dj4n1eaW. Just a reminder that Trump<U+0092>s proposed budget would cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by 17%.

Cut U.S. funding to the World Health Organization by more than half.

And make a nearly 10% cut to Health and Human Services.. Russia and other foreign adversaries can<U+0092>t hack a piece of paper.  

It<U+0092>s common sense. We need hand-marked paper ballots.
https://t.co/KcmXojgAzE. Scammers preying on our seniors were no match for the kindness of a stranger. Thank you, Rajbir, for your compassion and concern. With tax season gearing up, we must all be on alert.    
https://t.co/bdCCG17hLP. Beginning today, the Trump administration can disqualify more immigrants than before from receiving green cards if they think the potential green card recipient will ever use public assistance programs such as nutrition assistance or Medicaid. 

It<U+0092>s downright immoral. https://t.co/ewvrBGeJMp. What a beautiful tribute to Kobe and Gigi today. Vanessa courageously speaking about the loves of her life during this difficult time<U+0097>in front of millions of people across our nation, no less<U+0097>is a testament to her strength and her love. 
https://t.co/HO017AdkyQ. B. Smith is the definition of <U+0093>Black beauty.<U+0094> She lived an extraordinary life as a business leader &amp; role model. Instead of hiding her Alzheimer<U+0092>s diagnosis, B. Smith used her experience to shed light on the disease that impacts millions. Thinking of her family during this time. https://t.co/4oWUCfSdsh. Georgia families deserve someone in the U.S. Senate who will expand their access to health care, fight for working people, and combat voter suppression. I'm proud to endorse @ReverendWarnock's campaign<U+0097>I hope you<U+0092>ll check out his announcement video below. 
https://t.co/xfyIuXYzYB. Celebrating these ballerinas' brilliance and boldness this #BlackHistoryMonth.
https://t.co/OtGAkft7j5. In order to tackle gun violence, the climate crisis, and any other issue, we<U+0092>ll need a Senate that reflects our values as a country. Chip in now to help us flip the Senate.
https://t.co/1LvhlS0vlG. Taken just nine days apart. We must act to save our planet before it<U+0092>s too late.
https://t.co/VziY5xN6QF. ICE arrests at sensitive locations, like courthouses, can deter immigrants from seeking help from police. This makes everyone less safe. 
https://t.co/fG8NR6d1hE. Reminder: Attorney General Barr has yet to testify about political interference in the Roger Stone case. Judiciary Chairman Graham must hold a hearing immediately.. When Russia interfered in the 2016 election, they specifically targeted Black folks. We know Russia is at it again. 

That<U+0092>s why this week I joined @BET<U+0092>s #ReclaimYourVote campaign to get our community to raise their voice and combat voter suppression.
https://t.co/h32BphRu9G. In order to live up to our ideals as a nation, we must fight for economic justice. This means raising the minimum wage, making equal pay a reality, and creating a nation where one job is enough to pay the bills and keep a roof over your head.. Couldn<U+0092>t let the day go by without wishing my dear friend and civil rights hero @repjohnlewis a happy birthday. May this year be filled with even more #GoodTrouble. https://t.co/wE9rIkdODi. I<U+0092>ve known @conniechansf for many years and I<U+0092>m proud to endorse her for District 1 Supervisor. Connie has never forgotten the opportunities San Francisco gave her family, and as Supervisor, she<U+0092>ll make sure those opportunities are there for families for generations to come.. Russia interfered in the election of the president of the United States once<U+0097>and they<U+0092>re at it again.

Election security is national security. Republican leaders need to get serious about protecting our elections.
https://t.co/gTVCqmqQIs. Make no mistake, this is an effort by Governor Ducey and Republicans to push their anti-immigrant agenda. I stand in solidarity with @lucha_az and Arizonans to defeat SCR1007. 
https://t.co/24iXBJ5ZGg. We have a major special election for Congress on the ballot in California this March 3rd. I am proudly endorsing @ChristyforCA25 for #CA25 because she's an effective leader in her community. Join me. Together, let<U+0092>s keep CA-25 blue.. Elderly and low-income Americans in rural areas are particularly likely to forgo seeking care when rural hospitals close. We must ensure rural hospitals have the funding to stay open and serve their communities.
https://t.co/GGs23JJTUM. Trump<U+0092>s proposed budget includes:
<U+2192>$170 billion in cuts for college affordability programs
<U+2192>$76 billion in cuts for federal disability benefits
<U+2192>Cutting the EPA budget by 26%

It<U+0092>s no wonder Senate Budget Committee Republicans don<U+0092>t want to hold a hearing on his budget.. Californians, missed the voter registration deadline yesterday? Here<U+0092>s what you need to know: our state offers conditional voter registration. https://t.co/r58Fh6dqcC. As DA of San Francisco, @GeorgeGascon led fights to reform the Three Strikes Law &amp; get people convicted of nonviolent offenses greater opportunities to get their lives back on track. I know he<U+0092>ll work every day as DA of LA County to demand accountability from our justice system.. Today in 1942, FDR signed the executive order that led to the internment of approximately 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry. We can<U+0092>t erase this shameful part of our nation<U+0092>s history<U+0097>but I co-sponsored a bill last year to prevent atrocities like this from ever happening again.. Every day we fail to address the disparities in maternal mortality for Black women, we are failing our families. Every day we don<U+0092>t confront the persistent biases in our medical system, a mother could die. It<U+0092>s urgent we pass my Maternal CARE Act in the Senate.. Just shameful. The Trump administration continues to roll back environmental protections so special interests can profit<U+0097>at the expense of our health.
https://t.co/NwpHBnG0Tj. Today would have been Toni Morrison's 89th birthday. Thinking of the literary icon's powerful words, ""If you find a book you really want to read but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.""

Her voice will continue to inspire generations. Go write your story.. Outraged this happened to Jaylan. But sadly, we know experiences like his happens every day in America. We need stronger police and prosecutor accountability to root out and prevent abuses.
https://t.co/SsLjUE6B3a. Tomorrow is the last day to register to vote in California<U+0092>s primary. Go to https://t.co/3jw5qQcaXj now to make sure you can cast your ballot. 
https://t.co/xdrtvA03LW. A budget is a reflection of our values. Trump proposed cuts to Medicaid, student loan assistance, Social Security Disability Insurance, medical research, nutrition assistance, and more<U+0097>but included an additional $2 billion for his useless wall. It<U+0092>s downright heartless.. We<U+0092>re traumatizing generations of students because Republican members of Congress would rather do a favor for the @NRA than act to end the gun violence epidemic. 
https://t.co/Frule69Gr3. Gwen Ifill was the first Black woman to moderate a vice-presidential debate, a leader on PBS<U+0092> Washington Week in Review, and a trailblazer in journalism. She deserves to be honored this month and every month. #BlackHistoryMonth
https://t.co/0x8pOA7NC7. This week my colleagues and I introduced the Gun Records Restoration and Preservation Act. Besides helping keep our communities safe, this bill would allow researchers to study gun violence and its impact for the first time. It<U+0092>s critical we act.. Trump and his administration continue to chip away at protections for our public lands. But we won<U+0092>t let that happen without a fight.

Earlier this week my three bills to protect over 1 million acres of California lands passed in the House. It<U+0092>s now on the Senate to do the same.. Frederick Douglass once said, <U+0093>if there is no struggle, there is no progress.<U+0094> As we mark the day he chose as his birthday, we must remember his words and the struggle he<U+0097>and so many others<U+0097>endured. Our fight for justice continues.. Stephen Miller<U+0092>s white supremacist and anti-immigrant ideology has been the driving force behind some of this administration<U+0092>s cruelest policies. I introduced a resolution in the Senate yesterday calling for his immediate removal from the White House.. From Parkland to Northern Illinois University, my heart grieves for the communities and survivors whose lives were forever changed those fateful Valentine<U+0092>s Days. For our students<U+0092> sake, we need reasonable gun safety reforms. Now.. With the Republican-controlled Senate refusing to act on gun violence, parents and gun-safety groups across the country are making change at the local level. 
https://t.co/6nhgFDQNbG. Attorney General Barr thinks of himself as Trump<U+0092>s personal lawyer instead of the people<U+0092>s lawyer. It<U+0092>s imperative that the Senate Judiciary Committee put him under oath and get to the bottom of improper political interference at the DOJ.. Yesterday we had a Homeland Security committee meeting to discuss the coronavirus. No current Trump administration public health officials attended. 

Americans deserve public hearings as soon as possible to know what this administration is doing in response.. The U.S. is only 1 of 13 countries in the world where health outcomes for pregnant women are worse today than they were 25 years ago<U+0097>particularly for Black women. My Maternal CARE Act aims to change that by establishing implicit bias training for medical health professionals.. Amazon puts profits ahead of their employees<U+0092> health and safety. They must be held accountable. 
https://t.co/VdwXveCXoB. From taking on school desegregation to voter suppression, the @NAACP has been at the forefront of the fight for justice. Happy 111th Founder<U+0092>s Day! The work continues.. Attorney General Barr must immediately testify about political interference in the Roger Stone case. Americans deserve answers. Now.
https://t.co/Y89NHh0fV9. When we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, it<U+0092>s about celebrating those great leaders on whose shoulders we stand. But it<U+0092>s also a time to recognize &amp; combat the challenges we face, including racial disparities in our health care system, the wealth gap &amp; barriers to the ballot box.. Trump<U+0092>s callous budget is a disaster for:
<U+2192>College students
<U+2192>Seniors
<U+2192>Hungry families
<U+2192>Children

Americans deserve better.. My mother was a breast cancer researcher and I learned at a young age how women and girls are often underrepresented in science and other STEM fields. We must commit to invest in and empower future generations of #WomenInScience.. Your vote deserves to be protected from election interference. 

It<U+0092>s past time the United States embraced hand-marked paper ballots.. Trump<U+0092>s continued attacks on basic food and nutrition assistance directly hurts poor children and our nation<U+0092>s most vulnerable. It<U+0092>s downright immoral. 
https://t.co/1lEPDMGIsN. Trump<U+0092>s budget says a lot about his priorities. Saddle taxpayers with $2 billion for his vanity wall, while calling for cuts to: 

<U+2702><U+FE0F>Medicaid 
<U+2702><U+FE0F>Nutrition assistance
<U+2702><U+FE0F>Disability benefits
<U+2702><U+FE0F>The EPA
https://t.co/pNO1p6xLed. Representation in the media can have a profound effect on future generations, which is why the message of #HairLove is so important. Congratulations to all who were involved in this beautiful short! 
https://t.co/bHlStBwVo6. The federal minimum wage:

2009: $7.25/hour
2020: $7.25/hour

That<U+0092>s unconscionable. The House voted to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and it<U+0092>s time the Senate does the same.. My mother was very intentional about raising my sister and me as strong, Black women. She knew how the world would view us and try to treat us<U+0097>but she had an unparalleled optimism that we would see what was possible, unburdened by what has been. #BHM
https://t.co/o9nTzAgwzZ. Ivy will never forget the moment a student asked the question<U+0097><U+0093>Are we going to die today?<U+0094><U+0097>as they huddled together hiding from the Parkland gunman. 

It doesn<U+0092>t have to be this way. #MomentsThatSurvive

His twin brother, Lt Col. Yevgeny Vindman
Gordon Sondland

Late yesterday, Trump retaliated against those who spoke out<U+0097>and members of their family. This should concern all Americans.. Our entire planet is in the midst of a climate crisis. Any attempts by this administration or others to deny that puts us all in danger. 
https://t.co/St8R3oxMM5. A majority of senators voted to let Trump escape accountability<U+0097>and this is what he's doing to those who told the truth about what he did. This is only the beginning. 
https://t.co/m3UFwVn325. It is within our capacity to end HIV and AIDS within a generation<U+0097>and it starts with improving access to PrEP, testing, and working together to end the stigma. On National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, let<U+0092>s #StopHIVTogether.. It's clear Trump is sending a signal to anyone who dares to come forward with the truth. Lt. Col. Vindman showed devotion to duty, something this lawless president knows nothing about.
https://t.co/3XKF9QMG6l. We should be protecting our country<U+0092>s natural treasures, not selling them off to the highest bidder. 
https://t.co/M8dWyb6PcT. Don<U+0092>t let this go unnoticed: at least 138 Salvadorans came to America seeking a better and safer life<U+0097>only to be deported back to El Salvador and killed. It<U+0092>s horrifying. 
https://t.co/yrhm0fXYm8. Trump and his administration are punishing New York residents out of spite. We must reject Trump<U+0092>s attempts to divide people as <U+0093>us<U+0094> vs. <U+0093>them.<U+0094> 
https://t.co/554nzm7wCs. The true power and potential of our nation resides not with the president, but with the people. Always remember that.. Today the Republican-controlled Senate failed to hold Trump accountable. This continues a shameful history of two systems of justice: one for powerful people like Trump and one for everyone else. No one should be above the law, not even the president of the United States.. A true exoneration can only result from a fair trial<U+0097>and the Senate has not conducted a fair trial. Not even close.

That<U+0092>s why today I will vote to convict Donald Trump. 
https://t.co/RJzXhYg3MA. It couldn<U+0092>t be more simple: the president was afraid he was going to lose the next election, so he decided to cheat. 

This is a clear abuse of power, a misuse of the office of the presidency.

Trump thinks he<U+0092>s above the law<U+0097>and it<U+0092>s the Senate<U+0092>s job to tell him he's not.. Today Senators will decide if there is one system of justice for all<U+0097>or one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else. 

To defend the rule of law and the heart of our democracy, I will vote to remove Trump from office. I hope my fellow senators have the courage to join me.. We<U+0092>ve traumatized an entire generation by failing to act on gun violence. Yet not one word tonight on confronting this epidemic. #SOTU. The past three years Trump and his administration have:
<U+2192>Separated children from their parents and put them in cages
<U+2192>Enacted a travel ban that discriminated against people of color
<U+2192>Tried and failed to end DACA

Their anti-immigrant agenda doesn't make us safer. #SOTU. Reminder: Trump and his administration continue to roll back environmental protections to cozy up to powerful special interests. When the president puts polluters over people, he puts our lives and livelihoods at stake. #SOTU. Too many Americans are working 2-3 jobs to pay the bills &amp; put food on the table. An economy that only works for those at the top is an economy that is broken.

To truly address income inequality, we must commit to good-paying jobs, affordable childcare &amp; paid family leave. #SOTU. Staff here. While Senator Harris attends the State of the Union, we<U+0092>ll be tweeting to share with you some of her core issues and hopes for a better future for all. Stand by. #SOTU. Tonight at #SOTU, I<U+0092>m bringing Elder Joseph Paul who has dedicated his life to helping formerly incarcerated individuals reenter their communities. As our nation works to reform our criminal justice system, it is stories like his that must be heard. 
https://t.co/XhBkYk5Pet. The day my mother told us she had colon cancer was one of the worst days of my life. She was my inspiration and dedicated her life to finding a cure for breast cancer. I will always fight for public funding for cancer research<U+0097>too many lives have been cut short. #WorldCancerDay. Rosa Parks once said, <U+0093>I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people.<U+0094> On #RosaParksDay, let<U+0092>s honor her memory and continue her fight in the battle against injustice.. Years before the Montgomery Bus Boycott or the Greensboro sit-ins, Barbara Johns led her entire all-Black high school on strike for better conditions. 

Our youth have always led the fight against injustice. #BlackHistoryMonth
https://t.co/tQitA2NrQK. A fair trial in our system of justice includes witnesses and evidence. 

Trump<U+0092>s impeachment trial has neither. This is a cover-up.. As I said, Trump<U+0092>s border wall is a complete waste of taxpayer money and won<U+0092>t make us any safer.
https://t.co/YFK7yb3SHX. This National Gun Violence Survivors Week, I<U+0092>m thinking of Stephanie who I met on the campaign trail. Her daughter Dayla was only four years old when she was killed by a stray bullet. 

No one should ever have to go through that pain. #MomentsthatSurvive
https://t.co/TjZN1HDtNV. Trump<U+0092>s extended un-American travel ban undermines our nation<U+0092>s core values. It is clearly driven by hate, not security. 
https://t.co/x0fHFKRHWo. The vast majority of Americans wanted the United States Senate to produce new evidence and firsthand witnesses.

Yesterday, the Republican-controlled Senate blocked them<U+0097>ensuring this will not be a fair trial.. As we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, we honor Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain, and Joseph McNeil whose courageous activism at Greensboro Woolworth<U+0092>s 60 years ago today spurred a movement. They risked everything and forever changed our nation. https://t.co/v6ZmenF7VK. The Republican-controlled Senate chose to put party over country today by blocking firsthand witnesses and relevant documents at Trump<U+0092>s impeachment trial.

You can<U+0092>t have a fair trial without witnesses.. Californians: I know there is a lot going on but don't forget that today is the LAST day to sign up for health care through @CoveredCA. Spread the word and sign up now at https://t.co/ulGnArohz1.. Today eighty years ago, the first Social Security check was issued. Since then, Social Security has provided support to tens of millions of Americans. We should expand and strengthen it to give our nation<U+0092>s seniors the dignity they deserve.. There is still time to call your Senators and demand the Senate conduct a fair trial by hearing from witnesses and bringing forward documents: (202) 224-3121.. Medicaid covers everything from treatment for substance use to health care for some of our nation's most vulnerable. Cuts to Medicaid will have real consequences for families across the country. 
https://t.co/JXrNQsP0Q2. Fourteen years ago the world became a little dimmer when Coretta Scott King passed away. But when I look at the world around us &amp; the challenges we have to overcome, I am frequently reminded of her words, ""Freedom is never really won. You earn it &amp; win it in every generation."". Let<U+0092>s be real clear: even if Trump wanted to claim he<U+0092>s been exonerated after the trial, there cannot be a true acquittal if there hasn<U+0092>t been a fair trial. 

We need witnesses.
We need documents.

Anything less doesn<U+0092>t constitute a fair trial and fair process.. Since the beginning, you<U+0092>ve been by my side through thick and thin<U+0097>and I<U+0092>m proud every day to be able to call you my sister. Happy birthday, @mayaharris_! https://t.co/ijd7yjtnUU. 11 years after the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and women<U+0097>especially women of color<U+0097>are still fighting for fair pay. It's time corporations are held accountable for pay inequality in America.

Young women should grow up knowing their work is worth just as much as anyone else<U+0092>s.. The Trump Administration continues to turn their backs on hungry Americans when they need help to feed their families. It<U+0092>s immoral and downright cruel.   
https://t.co/Wi8cp6u3JP. Three years ago people from all walks of life came together to protest Trump<U+0092>s Muslim ban. Make no mistake, as Trump pushes to expand his ban we will continue to fight against it and any anti-Muslim hate speech from this Administration.
https://t.co/fJmj8Ri70U. Trump using his power to help himself and not our nation is a very serious matter and should concern all Americans. It<U+0092>s imperative the Senate conduct a fair trial by bringing forward firsthand witnesses and the documents that we know exist. 
https://t.co/zsaNootjTL. To my Republican colleagues in the Senate: if there is any sincerity in your interest for a fair trial, demand that Bolton testify. 

The United States Congress must fulfill its responsibility.. I agree, @fullfrontalsamb, it's past time we made robust paid leave for families a reality nationwide. Thanks for leading the charge on late night. 
https://t.co/077TPhLL8U. The level of callousness we<U+0092>ve seen by the Trump Administration directed towards immigrants goes against everything we stand for as a nation. Immigrants always have, and always will, make our nation stronger<U+0097>no matter how much money they have in their pocket. https://t.co/VTo8bVCDac. Today marks Holocaust Remembrance Day and 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. As we remember the six million Jews that were murdered in the Holocaust, let us recommit to the promise of <U+0091>never again<U+0092> by working to eliminate anti-Semitism and bigotry wherever we see it.. The Senate and the American people deserve to hear from firsthand witnesses<U+0097>including John Bolton. He must testify.. My heart aches for the communities in California that lost so many vibrant people yesterday. Keeping all the victims<U+0092> families and friends in my thoughts during this devastating time.
https://t.co/tuLTUTSCK6. My heart is completely broken for Vanessa, the entire Bryant family, and all those on board. A father, husband, philanthropist, and one of California<U+0092>s most brilliant icons, Kobe transcended sports.

Let's all hold those we love a little tighter today and every day.. <U+0093>He was small. He grew a lot.<U+0094>

David hadn<U+0092>t seen his son Byron since May of 2018 because of Trump<U+0092>s cruel family separation policy. This story is a powerful reminder of the devastating consequences of this callous decision. 
https://t.co/lkt4L1rYpF. For countless seniors, Medicare and Social Security can mean the difference between getting by or living in poverty. 

We cannot balance the budget on the backs of our nation<U+0092>s seniors. It<U+0092>s absurd even to suggest it. 
https://t.co/sS0EorKy2j. It<U+0092>s been three years since Trump signed an executive order to start his multi-billion dollar vanity wall project. Three years later and it<U+0092>s still a complete waste of taxpayer<U+0092>s hard-earned dollars.
https://t.co/dgqC0lY2B4. Conducting this impeachment trial is one of our biggest responsibilities as senators. 

Let<U+0092>s focus on the facts.
Let<U+0092>s focus on the law. 
Let<U+0092>s ensure this is a fair trial<U+0097>and that we deliver fair and impartial justice.. The invisible wounds of war like a traumatic brain injury are serious<U+0097>and Trump saying otherwise is absolutely despicable. 

They deserve better than their current commander in chief.
https://t.co/t6vmWhygeI. Pharmaceutical executives flooded communities with opioids and must be held accountable for the devastation they left in their wake. 
https://t.co/zonyR538ZO. It<U+0092>s this simple: Trump<U+0092>s tax scam drove up our nation<U+0092>s deficit<U+0097>now he wants to make cuts to Social Security and Medicare to make up for it. 

No one can argue with a straight face that this makes our country stronger.
https://t.co/DzUKInm9Px. Americans understand why firsthand witnesses and all available evidence must be brought before the Senate. 

A trial without witnesses is no trial at all.. The <U+0093>gay/trans panic<U+0094> defense has been used to justify horrific acts of violence against the LGBTQ+ community. I was proud to help make California the first state to outlaw it and am happy New Jersey is following suit. Let's ban it everywhere. 
https://t.co/a4cmuXtGD2. As we<U+0092>ve seen just this week from Kansas City to Seattle, too many communities are grieving in the aftermath of gun violence. 

Gun violence is an epidemic in our country and it<U+0092>s time for Congress to treat it as such.. 47 years after Roe v. Wade and we<U+0092>re still fighting to ensure women and trans people can make their own choices about their bodies.  

We cannot go back to the days before Roe v. Wade where people were dying from unsafe abortions. Reproductive health is on the ballot in 2020.. Senate Republicans rejected every single amendment to allow firsthand witnesses and documents in Trump<U+0092>s impeachment trial. 

Every single amendment. 

It<U+0092>s clear they don<U+0092>t want a trial<U+0097>they want a cover-up.. Today marks 10 years since the Citizens United ruling gave corporations and the top 1% the ability to funnel unlimited amounts of money into our elections. 

My colleagues and I introduced a constitutional amendment last year to overturn this horrendous decision.. Trump<U+0092>s impeachment trial begins today and McConnell wants to rush through it<U+0097>at the expense of truth and justice. 

We have to keep the pressure up and demand the Senate hear from first-hand witnesses, including Bolton and Mulvaney.. As we remember Dr. King today, let us also remember his counsel and fight for the best of who we are during moments of challenge and controversy. https://t.co/syyxO7PG1T. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. understood that you can<U+0092>t have equality among people if everyone doesn<U+0092>t have an equal shot at economic freedom and dignity. 

As we reflect on Dr. King<U+0092>s legacy this #MLKDay, let<U+0092>s recommit to continuing his fight for economic and racial justice.. 104-year-old Californian and Purple Heart recipient Major Bill White is asking for Valentine<U+0092>s Day cards. Please send to:

Operation Valentine
ATTN: Hold for Maj Bill White, USMC (Ret)
The Oaks at Inglewood
6725 Inglewood Ave.
Stockton, CA 95207
https://t.co/qyMSfKoy0v. It is imperative that the Senate hear from first-hand witnesses and have access to additional evidence in the impeachment trial. We must clearly show the American people this trial is a pursuit of truth<U+0097>not a cover-up.. A victory this week in the fight against voter suppression. We must continue to reduce barriers to voting so more voices are heard at the ballot box. 
https://t.co/di3GbwZinR. We passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963. It is now 2020. 

Women are still paid on average 80 cents on the dollar.
Black women 61 cents.
Native American women 58 cents. 
Latinas 53 cents. 

This is an injustice and it's got to change.. Women shouldn<U+0092>t have to choose between their careers and taking care of their children or parents. It<U+0092>s time we guarantee families up to six months of paid family and medical leave nationwide. 
https://t.co/zi6gt8Bk6i. It is not an exaggeration: poor women and women of color will die because Republican legislatures across our nation are telling women what we can and can<U+0092>t do with our bodies. Keep your hands off.. Grateful to be back home and in Los Angeles this weekend to speak with @LALabor. Together we will continue the fight for justice. https://t.co/DO5uPwpWFn. The Democratic Party must commit to showing up for Black women all the time, not just during an election year. 
https://t.co/RebZ5pIkmK. There is nothing more powerful than a group of determined sisters marching alongside their determined sons, brothers, fathers, and friends standing up for what we know is right. #WomensMarch. As we saw almost three years ago at the first Women<U+0092>s March, women are a force that cannot be dismissed or pushed to the side. We will rise to the challenge, fight, and win. 
https://t.co/PhNtH7qlNi. The responsibility to uphold the Constitution and our system of justice now rests on the shoulders of each and every member of the United States Senate. 

The very integrity of the Senate will be on trial starting next week.

It is on us to have a fair trial that seeks the truth.. It would be wholly inappropriate for the Senate to advance any judicial nominee who Trump nominated while he<U+0092>s on trial. This is a win for our democracy.
https://t.co/4sPJnhTdXb. It takes courage to share your story<U+0097>especially as you are processing.

@AyannaPressley: thank you for being an inspiration to us all. 
https://t.co/n2dtb6hpfk. Attorney General Barr must testify before Congress about what he knew and when he knew it. Under oath.. History is watching. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to have the courage, foresight, and patriotism to rise above partisanship and act in the interest of our nation.

We must reaffirm that no one is above the law.. Last night<U+0092>s Lev Parnas interview couldn<U+0092>t have made it more clear<U+0097>the Senate must hear from first-hand witnesses and demand the White House turn over documents related to the withholding of military aid from Ukraine.. Low-income communities and communities of color have shouldered the burden of environmental injustice for decades. This reckless move by the Trump Administration would continue to endanger their lives and their health. 
https://t.co/lxCpYbeV1f. The Senate now faces a choice: will we insist we have one system of justice that applies equally to all? Or will we show the nation that some are above the law? 

The integrity of our system of justice is on the line.. Virginia made history today. This would not be possible without the voters who turned out last year to flip the Virginia General Assembly blue. Local elections matter. 
https://t.co/mmd7e1zutb. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta on this day in 1929. Today, let us not just share his quotes and his photos, but honor his life by continuing what he stood for, fought for, and died for. Let Dr. King<U+0092>s work challenge us to realize our highest ideals as a nation.. I believe in an America where it only takes one job to keep a roof over your head and put food on the table.

An America where children don't fear going to school because of mass shootings.

An America where health care is a human right.

Let<U+0092>s make this our America.. The cruelty of the Trump Administration knows no bounds. 

America will be judged harshly for abandoning our moral leadership and turning our back to those fleeing violence and harm.
https://t.co/XzMdpxrFbv. Let<U+0092>s be clear<U+0097>any order from Trump to block witnesses or evidence is further proof of his efforts to obstruct Congress from doing its job.
 
Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, and anyone with firsthand knowledge of the president<U+0092>s misconduct must testify.. We lost our biggest college football fan in 2018 when my press secretary Tyrone passed away from cancer. But his passion for his alma mater and @ClemsonFB has lived on with me and the rest of our campaign and Senate office families. Once again, I<U+0092>m #ALLIN for him tonight. https://t.co/wJhadSJfEz. If Black students have a Black teacher by third grade, they're 13% more likely to go to college. 

If they have two Black teachers by third grade, they're 32% more likely to go to college. 

Representation matters.
https://t.co/PpB4IXEz07. .@CoryBooker<U+0097>every moment on the campaign trail with you, my dear friend, was a joy. I'm incredibly proud of the issues you elevated and the work your team put in day in and day out to fight for justice. We<U+0092>re all better because you were in this race.. Speaker Pelosi is right: McConnell doesn<U+0092>t want a Senate trial<U+0097>he wants a cover-up.
https://t.co/vCQx6PU2HC. Your voice deserves to be heard at the ballot box. Congress must act to restore the full protections of the Votings Rights Act and also:
<U+2192>Make automatic voter registration the norm
<U+2192>Turn Election Day into a national holiday
<U+2192>Expand early voting. Black women are 3-4x more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Lives literally depend on combating implicit bias in our health care system. 

My Maternal CARE Act will help solve this epidemic.
https://t.co/eKnORMbgzV. We<U+0092>re facing a mental health crisis. Too many Americans lack access to the care they need, and millions live in an area with a shortage of mental health professionals. That<U+0092>s why I<U+0092>ve introduced a bill that utilizes telemedicine to expand access to mental health services.. Atatiana Jefferson<U+0092>s father suffered a heart attack and died just weeks after she was shot and killed in her own home. 

Now, Atatiana<U+0092>s mother has passed away.

My heart aches for her entire family who have endured immeasurable trauma and injustice. 
https://t.co/ibW0dzKKQG. Yesterday my colleagues and I introduced the No War Against Iran Act, which would deny funds for unauthorized military action against Iran. 

Congress must act quickly so Trump doesn<U+0092>t unilaterally take our country into another war.. Drug companies have been jacking up prices for years to line their own pockets at the expense of Americans<U+0092> health and wellbeing. Enough. We can<U+0092>t put prescription drugs out of reach for patients who need them.
https://t.co/46yHa9h3VH. Whether it<U+0092>s improving our education system, ensuring access to physical and mental health care treatment, protecting the environment, or overhauling our criminal justice system, it all affects our children. 

It<U+0092>s crucial we think about them and their future.. In California, we<U+0092>ve made it easy for young people to get politically involved. If you<U+0092>re 16 or 17-years-old you can pre-register to vote and be automatically registered on your 18th birthday. Spread the word and sign up at https://t.co/3jw5qQcaXj.. There are so many teachers like Keisha who go the extra mile for their students and their community. It<U+0092>s time we invest in them like they<U+0092>ve invested in the next generation. 
https://t.co/8Kjg1k07mL. Americans deserve to hear from John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney. To my Republican colleagues, it<U+0092>s time to choose: a Senate cover-up or a fair trial based in truth and justice?. We must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law. There aren<U+0092>t two sets of rules<U+0097>one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else.. <U+0093>After Orlando, [the mass shootings] never stopped. The country had me on the road for a while every week. I have driven 850,000 miles to put up crosses.<U+0094>

My heart aches that we haven<U+0092>t ended the gun violence epidemic in the 23 years since Greg started making crosses. https://t.co/uxgx1BqvKI. Puerto Rico has already suffered so much. Keeping these Americans in my prayers as recovery begins. 
https://t.co/3OZSvBSgYz. Let<U+0092>s be clear: Mitch McConnell doesn<U+0092>t want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up. 

History will judge the actions taken by the Senate at this moment in time. Know that I<U+0092>ll be fighting on the side of justice and accountability.. For those who want to help the victims of Australia<U+0092>s fires<U+0097>here are a number of ways you can make a difference right now.

https://t.co/kPhVFcb6Dy. This Administration continues to push its anti-immigrant agenda<U+0097>moving to drastically increase immigration fees by up to 83%. This goes against everything we stand for as a nation. I'm leading a group of senators to push back. https://t.co/hYC78DSXuU. .@JulianCastro, my friend <U+0097> your voice was essential to this presidential race. You and your team spoke truth about the critical issues facing our nation and always fought for justice. We are all better for it.. Rang in the new year with loved ones. May 2020 bring you an abundance of happiness and joy as we continue to fight for a better future for all. https://t.co/7RtCGu2VGk. My friend John Lewis has gone up the rough side of the mountain many times before and his battle with pancreatic cancer is no different. Our nation is praying for you, John.. It's clear McConnell is more interested in covering up the president<U+0092>s misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. 

History will judge the actions taken by the Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I<U+0092>ll be fighting for justice.. Far too many Native women are dying and disappearing, their cases going unreported, unsolved, or untouched by law enforcement. We must speak out for them<U+0097>and be there for those who return home.
https://t.co/SPgCFyaVqQ. Sending my warmest wishes to all who are celebrating Kwanzaa in the United States and around the world. May your days be filled with peace, love, and happiness..

This Christmas Eve, I<U+0092>m thinking of our service members overseas, families who<U+0092>ve lost everything in this year<U+0092>s wildfires and other natural disasters, and the children separated from their parents at the border. May we show some compassion this holiday season.. As we head into the new year, I'm thinking of the nearly 700,000 people who will lose nutrition assistance<U+0097>including college students. This attack by the Trump Administration is cruel and immoral. Students can<U+0092>t learn if they<U+0092>re hungry.
https://t.co/sg0gPFAgXg. Absolutely horrific. Trump's cruel policies have left families vulnerable to violence and kidnapping. Don't let this go unnoticed. 
https://t.co/qZrrQXEfXa. Happy Hanukkah! Sending my warmest wishes to those celebrating in the United States and around the world. May these eight nights be a time of reflection and hope as you gather with friends, family, or the family you create.. Mitch McConnell has already signaled he has no interest in a fair trial. 

He<U+0092>s preventing witnesses from testifying and all but announced a verdict. This isn<U+0092>t a trial<U+0097>it<U+0092>s a cover-up.. Trump and Republicans jammed through a trillion-dollar giveaway to the top 1% and the wealthiest corporations. 

It couldn<U+0092>t be more clear: this tax scam did little to help working families. It must be repealed. 
https://t.co/Qufe5PwR97. My team and I are thinking of @TDucklo and all of @TeamJoe this weekend. Cancer is horrible and indiscriminate, but with the support of friends and family<U+0097>and the grit and determination I know TJ has<U+0097>he will defeat it. I<U+0092>m praying for healing and recovery.. A monumental move to ensure federal workers can be there for the newest addition to their family. But we must go further by guaranteeing up to 6 months of paid family and medical leave nationwide.
https://t.co/zxq8cj9VKu. I<U+0092>ve never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions. Yet that's what Trump and McConnell are doing.

No court would let a trial to proceed this way<U+0097>and neither should the Senate.. An officer shot and killed Atatiana Jefferson in her own home. While her family will never get back what they lost, this serves as a small, but significant, move towards justice. We must set a national standard for deadly force to prevent these tragedies from destroying families. https://t.co/NmZJi0myoj. History will judge the actions taken by the United States Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I<U+0092>ll be fighting for justice and accountability when the impeachment trial begins in the Senate, and my colleagues should too.. I can<U+0092>t think of anyone more worthy of this honor.

In 2020, we must have their back.. The House has voted to impeach Trump.

I commend Speaker Pelosi and those who voted to put our Constitution above politics.

It<U+0092>s now up to us in the Senate to hold him accountable.. Congress must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law, and that there aren't two sets of rules<U+0097>one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else.
https://t.co/VLrEN0vvFd. Trump has committed impeachable acts in plain sight. He extorted a foreign government for political gain. It is Congress<U+0092> constitutional duty to seek justice.

Make sure you and your friends and family are covered. Go to https://t.co/zmKsbKOrYE now.. The day 20 six and seven-year-olds were murdered in their classrooms in Sandy Hook should have ended inaction on gun violence in our schools<U+0097>but it didn<U+0092>t. 

For the sake of our children, we need to pass universal background checks and close loopholes.. Each empty box in this yearbook represents a family and community shattered by gun violence at schools. 

It<U+0092>s been almost 300 days since the bipartisan gun safety bill passed the House. McConnell, it<U+0092>s time for the Senate to vote. 
https://t.co/kuOekcMOyD. When someone takes an oath to work in the White House and earn a taxpayer-funded salary, they work for the people<U+0097>not a divisive, dangerous, and hateful ideology. Stephen Miller<U+0092>s views go against everything we should stand for as a country. He must be removed immediately.. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and those running to lead our nation must show up for them<U+0097>not just with words, but with action. https://t.co/LEjcpzHxfj. Russia attacked our elections to make Donald Trump president of the United States. They<U+0097>and others<U+0097>will try it again. Hand-marked paper ballots and upgrades to our election infrastructure are vital to protecting our democracy.. Tom Joyner is a legend and has played a critical role in building community and lifting up all voices. He is Black history. It was an honor to be a guest on the @TJMShow but to also call him a friend. Enjoy retirement!. The House will vote on two articles of impeachment against the President: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
 
Make no mistake: Trump will continue to tweet lies until then. We know the truth<U+0097>he is our greatest national security threat and must be held accountable.. Trump<U+0092>s anti-immigrant agenda couldn<U+0092>t be more clear. 

He has separated families. 
Locked children in cages. 
Attempted to end protections for Dreamers. 
Tried to spend billions on a wasteful border wall. 

These disastrous and cruel policies must come to an end.. In many states, the last day of open enrollment is December 15 (Californians, you have until January 31, 2020). Sign up today to find a plan that works for you and your family: https://t.co/zmKsbKOrYE.. Congress has failed the families and students of Newtown.

It has never been more urgent that we take action on gun violence and stop this epidemic. 
https://t.co/9R2ol84y4T. Three children have died from the flu.

It<U+0092>s not national security, it<U+0092>s white supremacy<U+0097>something that has no place in our country, federal government, and especially not the White House. He must go.. .@GretaThunberg has proven that one voice can make a difference. Her leadership in the international fight for climate justice has inspired countless young people to take up the charge for a more sustainable future. I hope our current leadership is listening. https://t.co/Vt5uxWIz1L. To my supporters, it is with deep regret<U+0097>but also with deep gratitude<U+0097>that I am suspending my campaign today.

Join me in helping them get elected: https://t.co/Kboaxi3MVL. .@JoeBiden is a man who learned to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity, living by the words his parents taught him: <U+0093>No one<U+0092>s better than you, Joe, but you<U+0092>re better than nobody.<U+0094> That empathy, that decency, the belief that everybody counts<U+0097>that<U+0092>s who Joe is. https://t.co/RW8o39zQJL. If you can volunteer as a poll worker for early voting and Election Day, I hope you<U+0092>ll do it. You can help make sure this election runs fairly and safely<U+0097>and that<U+0092>s one of the most crucial things any of us can do for our country right now. Sign up here:<U+00A0>https://t.co/ZtXWL9aTlM https://t.co/hrlYejlE7y. Chadwick came to the White House to work with kids when he was playing Jackie Robinson. You could tell right away that he was blessed. To be young, gifted, and Black; to use that power to give them heroes to look up to; to do it all while in pain <U+0096> what a use of his years. https://t.co/KazXV1e7l7. If you<U+0092>re looking to take action<U+0097>or looking to educate yourselves on these issues<U+0097>we<U+0092>ve gathered some resources from the @ObamaFoundation that can help at<U+00A0>https://t.co/V7b0mJoZiL.. As people exercise their right to protest all across the country<U+0096><U+0096>let the undeniable paths of our progress be a guide going forward: peaceful, sustained protest; strategic, committed organizing; and purposeful, overwhelming participation at the ballot box.. I commend the players on the @Bucks for standing up for what they believe in, coaches like @DocRivers, and the @NBA and @WNBA for setting an example. It<U+0092>s going to take all our institutions to stand up for our values. https://t.co/rUGETgAt7P. Don<U+0092>t let them convince you that your vote doesn<U+0092>t matter. Make a plan to vote and register at https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T. Vote early if you can. Tell everyone you know to do the same.. There's a reason some people are working to make it harder to vote, especially for people of color. It<U+0092>s because when we show up, things change. 

https://t.co/g7SXqAbof5. Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement, embodies the idea of ordinary people<U+0092>s ability to create change. She fought for the right to vote and led a movement of young people towards the fight for freedom. You should know her name:

https://t.co/6z0o7uUiBg. While other countries around the world have successfully managed this pandemic, we've seen things get worse. It's not too late for us to work towards recovery, but it's going to require leaders with coherent plans to move us forward.
https://t.co/qWNaFGUa4d. Tonight our next President @JoeBiden made the case for his vision for this country and his plan to get there. I'll be doing everything I can over these next 75 days to make sure we get it done. Join us: https://t.co/Kboaxi3MVL. Do make a plan right now for how you<U+0092>re going to vote and vote early, by mail or in person: https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T https://t.co/vIPPT03VTf. .@JoeBiden made me a better president. I<U+0092>m asking you to believe in his and Kamala<U+0092>s ability to help make us a better country. More importantly, I<U+0092>m asking you to believe in your own and to help them, in this election and beyond. 
https://t.co/YYEAFxx4nW. The 19th amendment is the legacy of all those who marched and organized for transformational legislative change. Progress isn<U+0092>t about just politics or protest<U+0096><U+0096>it<U+0092>s about both. 100 years later, we<U+0092>re all so much better off because of their commitment. https://t.co/jnQ7vam64a. As Michelle said, we<U+0092>ve got to do everything we can to elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. So make sure you have a plan to vote. Vote early. And tell everybody you know to register to vote at https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T. https://t.co/rAUsWHusbV. Over the past few months, I<U+0092>ve spent a lot of time listening to music with my family. I wanted to share some of my favorites from the summer<U+0097>including songs from some of the artists at this week<U+0092>s @DemConvention. Hope you enjoy it. https://t.co/2ZFwdN46jR. If you're in a state where you have the option to vote early, do that now. The more votes in early, the less likely you're going to see a last minute crunch, both at polling places and in states where mail-in ballots are permitted. Then tell everyone you know.. I talked to @davidplouffe about these attempts to undermine the election, what<U+0092>s at stake right now, and why we have to do everything we can to elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/9bqgWVUncE. Everyone depends on the USPS. Seniors for their Social Security, veterans for their prescriptions, small businesses trying to keep their doors open. They can't be collateral damage for an administration more concerned with suppressing the vote than suppressing a virus.. I<U+0092>ve known Senator @KamalaHarris for a long time. She is more than prepared for the job. She<U+0092>s spent her career defending our Constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. This is a good day for our country. Now let<U+0092>s go win this thing. https://t.co/duJhFhWp6g. I will never forget the commitment to reconciliation and peace that I encountered in Hiroshima in 2016. The memory of August 6, 1945, must never fade; it allows us to fight complacency. It fuels our moral imagination. It allows us to change. https://t.co/A9lKu0c0PR. We have to treat voting as the most important action we can take on behalf of democracy. So make sure you are registered to vote. Request a mail-in ballot early and send it back early. Then get your family and friends to do it, too. Every vote counts. https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T. Let<U+0092>s guarantee that every citizen has equal representation in our government. And end partisan gerrymandering, so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians. And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster<U+0097>a Jim Crow relic<U+0096><U+0096>then that<U+0092>s what we should do.. We can do this by making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including formerly incarcerated people. Let<U+0092>s also make sure to add more polling places, expand early voting, and make Election Day a national holiday.. We've got to fight harder to protect the right to vote. It<U+0092>s one of the most powerful tools we have<U+0096><U+0096>and we can start by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Once we pass that, we should continue marching forward to make it even better.. Today is the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act<U+0096><U+0096>one of the crowning achievements of our democracy. But once the Supreme Court weakened it, some state legislatures unleashed a flood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder, especially in communities of color.. I<U+0092>m proud to endorse this diverse and hopeful collection of thoughtful, empathetic, and highly qualified Democrats. If you<U+0092>re in one of their districts or states, make sure you vote for them this fall. And if you can, vote early<U+0097>by mail or in person.<U+00A0>https://t.co/PSm3Rf3wkF https://t.co/7RXrJriBz8. Welcome home, @AstroBehnken and @Astro_Doug!

This pandemic is far from over<U+0096><U+0096>and our medical professionals continue to put their lives on the line to keep our country going. @JoeBiden and I had a chance to thank Dr. @Craig_A_Spencer for his work during the Ebola crisis and this current pandemic. https://t.co/FlyGFIUHl7. John believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage and a longing to do what<U+0092>s right. We are so lucky to have had him show us the way. I offered some thoughts today on his life and how, like him, we can give it all we have. https://t.co/7UHT86OzEj. John spent his entire life fighting for justice and equality<U+0096><U+0096>and now he has left behind his marching orders for all of us. 

https://t.co/Cs5H6ckezR. Michelle and I have spent a lot of time together these past few months. We<U+0092>ve had a lot of good talks<U+0097>and this one<U+0092>s up there with the best. Take a listen to the very first episode of Michelle<U+0092>s podcast: https://t.co/JEaVgT6GPC. https://t.co/oRn1figrRK. It's National Vote By Mail Day. Voting by mail is easy and safe. Take a few minutes to request your vote-by-mail ballot, then get your family and friends to do the same. Request your ballot early, send it back early, and fill it out carefully. Get started: https://t.co/pmWQqs4PbB https://t.co/JlOWmkJG57. We're 100 days away from Election Day and there is too much at stake to sit this one out. Now's a good time to make sure you're registered to vote<U+0096><U+0096>and to make sure your friends and family are, too. https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I got the chance to talk to the next generation of activists and advocates in the disability rights movement<U+0096><U+0096>they're continuing the work of the activists in @CripCampFilm and I couldn't be prouder of them. https://t.co/k7r5JJUC9T. Although we<U+0092>ve seen some positive findings recently about the possibilities of developing a vaccine for COVID-19, this article gives a good summary of why it may take months before any effective vaccine can be widely distributed. https://t.co/C1nPSNwKBa. I sat down with @JoeBiden to talk about the most pressing issues of our time. He's exactly the leader we need right now<U+0096><U+0096>with the vision, the plans, and character to move America forward.

Let's get to work: https://t.co/AsR0wFSWRC https://t.co/YCjqCCCtcx. Ten years ago, I signed Wall Street reform into law. It was the most sweeping set of financial regulations since the Great Depression<U+0097>and it<U+0092>s still working today to prevent another one. Now, it<U+0092>s up to us to protect it and keep fighting for an economy that works for everybody. https://t.co/jbV7p64xZR. Not many of us get to live to see our own legacy play out in such a meaningful, remarkable way. John Lewis did:

https://t.co/KbVfYt5CeQ. Some thoughts on the Reverend C.T. Vivian, a pioneer who pulled America closer to our founding ideals and a friend who I will miss greatly. https://t.co/kDsGhU2BF4. Here<U+0092>s a quick look at how our response stacks up with countries around the world:

https://t.co/AEIlpub72e. The latest data offers a tragic reminder that the virus doesn<U+0092>t care about spin or ideology<U+0096><U+0096>and that the best thing we can do for our economy is to deal with our public health crisis.

https://t.co/c1iGYA6pr3. Voting by mail shouldn't be a partisan issue<U+0096><U+0096>especially during a pandemic. Everybody should be able to request an absentee ballot, and make their voice heard in every election. https://t.co/enlhkichz3. It<U+0092>s clear our communities are crying out for change<U+0097>and what that change looks like is up to us. That<U+0092>s why it<U+0092>s important to take a hard look at all the perspectives and proposals out there, even the ones we disagree with. It<U+0092>s how we<U+0092>ll come up with solutions that last.. Finally, here<U+0092>s a look at how Germany reshaped police training after the horrors of World War II and how this approach might be useful to other countries today.
https://t.co/C9oFaqTxo8. And here<U+0092>s a counterbalance that argues for substantial reforms to policing and oversight but not fewer police.
https://t.co/DwQoyobGRX. Here<U+0092>s a piece that outlines the need for a more aggressive overhaul of policing.
https://t.co/yJlSb0MmyK. As communities around the country try to reimagine how law enforcement can operate in a just, effective and non-discriminatory way, these articles provide some useful background and differing viewpoints on the issue. 
https://t.co/tm08fXSkRF. For too long, gerrymandering has contributed to stalled progress and warped our representative government. Redistricting begins next year<U+0097>let<U+0092>s all do our part to protect and restore our democracy.

Join me and @allontheline in the fight for fair maps: https://t.co/rU2hd4812n https://t.co/hbeQAjzRlv. Our founding promise has never been guaranteed. Each generation has been called to bring us a little closer to our highest ideals<U+0097>and history<U+0092>s calling on us right now. So let<U+0092>s all do whatever we can to help @JoeBiden expand that promise to all Americans. https://t.co/5zby4l3W5H. This holiday weekend, let<U+0092>s be safe and smart. It<U+0092>s going to take all of us to beat this virus. So wear a mask. Wash your hands. And listen to the experts, not the folks trying to divide us. That's the only way we<U+0092>ll do this<U+0097>together.
https://t.co/UwNKAzL8JU. Today I<U+0092>m tipping my hat to all the giants in the Negro Leagues, from Satchel Paige to Toni Stone and so many others. Their brave example, first set 100 years ago, changed America<U+0092>s pastime for the better<U+0096><U+0096>opening it up for new generations of players and fans alike. https://t.co/05jWocKs17. Jim<U+0092>s courage and persistence helped change America for the better. And so did every American who marched, organized, stood up, came out<U+0097>or changed their own heart because they love someone who did. Happy anniversary, everybody. https://t.co/t8ULh2c0P5. Michelle and I want every kid in Chicago to grow up knowing even better opportunities than we had. We<U+0092>re happy to help Chicago Connected reach every kid in the city. This is where I found a purpose and a family<U+0096><U+0096>and it<U+0092>ll always be our home. https://t.co/ofSCxK8cJC. I<U+0092>m joining my friend @JoeBiden tomorrow to talk about everything that<U+0092>s at stake in this election. 

I hope you<U+0092>ll join us, too. This is a critical moment in our history<U+0096><U+0096>and all of us have to do our part to build this country into what we know it can be. https://t.co/diQxk3uFH2. Juneteenth has never been a celebration of victory, or an acceptance of the way things are. It's a celebration of progress. It's an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history, change is possible<U+0096><U+0096>and there is still so much work to do.
https://t.co/5XCRdnk3iR. ...and now to stand up for those ideals, we have to move forward and elect @JoeBiden and a Democratic Congress that does its job, protects DREAMers, and finally creates a system that<U+0092>s truly worthy of this nation of immigrants once and for all.. Eight years ago this week, we protected young people who were raised as part of our American family from deportation. Today, I'm happy for them, their families, and all of us. We may look different and come from everywhere, but what makes us American are our shared ideals<U+0085>. And here are two more essays that powerfully express the hope, heart, grief, and rage that are driving this moment of potential change. 

Racism Is Terrible. Blackness Is Not: https://t.co/64b0Xms1LE

The Trayvon Generation: https://t.co/HtnRelulCP. These Nashville teenagers are representative of the remarkable leadership we<U+0092>re seeing from young people across the country and around the world. 

https://t.co/TMA2BmKyq9. Today reminds us that progress might be slow. It might take decades. But no matter what things might look like today, it<U+0092>s always possible. Happy Pride month, everybody. https://t.co/ey7p2TgEEf. This young generation makes me optimistic about our future. By protesting, they<U+0092>re speaking up and shining a light on injustice<U+0096><U+0096>and one way we can support them is to vote for people who<U+0092>ll change the laws on every level.
https://t.co/3Ng1IC73nY. In Columbia, Maryland, young people wielded social media to connect across boundaries, amplify voices, and enact some real change.  
https://t.co/RWcfVwdv4j. This group of Nashville teens led a peaceful march with tens of thousands of people in their community. 
https://t.co/KWVsI0Z53E. Over the past few weeks, we<U+0092>ve seen young people in every corner of the country step up and become leaders. Through organization and mobilization, they<U+0092>re showing us how we can sustain this momentum to bring about real change. https://t.co/UKnowQM2Lj. It<U+0092>s too early to tell if it<U+0092>s permanent, but the changes brought on by COVID-19 are forcing many of us to reflect on what really matters in our lives. https://t.co/9qlOdWKAuO. As has always been true at key moments in history, it<U+0092>s going to depend on young people to go out there and rewrite what is possible.

I couldn<U+0092>t be prouder of all the young people leading that change right now. Here<U+0092>s my advice for the Class of 2020: https://t.co/XD2n7LEihk. We<U+0092>ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice<U+0096><U+0096>but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health. Today, I talked to @repjohnlewis, Bryan Stevenson, and @MBK_Alliance activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time. https://t.co/PAsWb607EU. On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we #WearOrange to honor the victims and survivors of gun violence<U+0096><U+0096>which continues to disproportionately harm Black communities. Then keep speaking up, voting, and changing laws across the country.. Third, every city in this country should be a @MBK_Alliance community. We have 250 cities, counties, and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. Join us: https://t.co/RZRwimA3SO. Second, every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms. We need mayors, county executives, and those in positions of power to make this a priority. Take the pledge: https://t.co/c8pAlhJsPJ. First, there are specific evidence-based reforms that would build trust, save lives, and lead to a decrease in crime, too. You can find clear, actionable recommendations right here: https://t.co/V7b0mJoZiL. Real change requires protest to highlight a problem, and politics to implement practical solutions and laws. As I mentioned yesterday in our @MBK_Alliance town hall, there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now:. In our @MBK_Alliance town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. From 1962, it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt: https://t.co/50F9ZP3JhQ. And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests.

https://t.co/ftmm5crbgg. Second, a reminder of the difference politics and voting can make in changing who has the power to make real change in a community like Ferguson with a history of blatant discriminatory law enforcement practices.

https://t.co/U0z9wMOx8z. Here<U+0092>s a useful read<U+0096><U+0096>a reminder of the importance of de-escalation by police in their interactions with protestors.

https://t.co/Ondw85gQNL. ""Let<U+0092>s do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice don<U+0092>t matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who you<U+0092>re voting for. And that<U+0092>s how we're going to hit 'em."" https://t.co/WX6oLNRtI2. I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts.. If you want to take concrete action, but you<U+0092>re not sure how, we<U+0092>ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who<U+0092>ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. https://t.co/2KcB4T3b0I. 5. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away.. 4. So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isn<U+0092>t between protest and politics<U+0096><U+0096>we have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform.. 3. To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels.. 2. The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices.. 1. The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence<U+0096><U+0096>not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support.. Ultimately, it<U+0092>s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering:. As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, I<U+0092>ve heard many ask how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change.. I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change<U+0096><U+0096>and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv. If you believe in a more just, more generous, more democratic America, now is the time to fight for it. Here<U+0092>s a terrific way to register voters, organize communities, and ramp up turnout in the battleground states that will decide this election: https://t.co/FmN8RCJymg https://t.co/R5FZ6OBfxz. On Memorial Day, we honor those who gave all for us. That takes different forms this year, but it<U+0092>s even more vital with the loss of so many veterans to COVID-19.

The way they lived, in service to one another, should be our roadmap in the months ahead. https://t.co/S0sqvuicm8. And here<U+0092>s more on the approach Sweden has taken, which differs from some of its neighbors: 

https://t.co/Qw5R0O5RhM. As all 50 states begin the process of reopening, here are three articles that offer some lessons from other countries about the tradeoffs and policies involved. First, here<U+0092>s what European nations have done to support workers:

https://t.co/OXJMUaFDKo. The Class of 2020 is full of the leaders we need to bend the arc of history toward a better future<U+0097>and our HBCU grads have the talent, skills, and vision to lead that change. I couldn't be prouder of all of you. https://t.co/Qlr5ivBvpJ. As Chicago navigates the health crisis, its residents continue to show up for one another in their communities. It<U+0092>s one of the things I love most about the city<U+0097>and one of the many reasons it<U+0092>s such a good home for the @ObamaFoundation. https://t.co/ALo7kusc8K. Congrats to the high school Class of 2020, as well as to the teachers, coaches, and most of all, parents and family who<U+0092>ve guided you along the way. Thanks for letting me be part of your big day! https://t.co/RjYvHs2BhC. Congratulations to the HBCU Class of 2020! Michelle and I are so proud of you. As you set out to change the world, we<U+0092>ll be the wind at your back. Can<U+0092>t wait to see what you achieve. https://t.co/PCsjkJJTXi. Graduating is a big achievement no matter what, but with all that the Class of 2020 has dealt with to get across the finish line, I think they<U+0092>ve earned a little celebration. I hope you<U+0092>ll all join me in honoring them at 2PM ET and 8PM ET. https://t.co/dBK5nll7w8. Michelle and I want to do our part to give all you parents a break today, so we<U+0092>re reading <U+0093>The Word Collector<U+0094> for @chipublib. It<U+0092>s a fun book that vividly illustrates the transformative power of words<U+0096><U+0096>and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did. https://t.co/ADYbL6Dzg4. Despite all the time that<U+0092>s been lost, we can still make real progress against the virus, protect people from the economic fallout, and more safely approach something closer to normal if we start making better policy decisions now.
https://t.co/pfokyI8GiB. Change comes when all of us step up and play our part in this democracy. By encouraging our young people, like these students from @ChiPubSchools, to start engaging in our civic life today, we<U+0092>re already creating something better for tomorrow. https://t.co/9ScwPruoyA. Even if you can<U+0092>t give the moms in your life a hug today, I hope you can give them an extra thank you today. Thank you and Happy Mother<U+0092>s Day to the woman who makes it all possible. Love you, @michelleobama. https://t.co/E9ebxaSBpy. There<U+0092>s no limit to the devotion I<U+0092>ve seen in teachers like these @ChiPubSchools educators. Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become. I couldn<U+0092>t be more thankful for their work, especially as they shift lessons online to keep students on track during this crisis. https://t.co/xYECcrAxdE. I<U+0092>ve always loved joining commencements<U+0096><U+0096>the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice. Even if we can<U+0092>t get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones. https://t.co/ngR2ykx3A2. The folks of the Chicago @fooddepository<U+0097>and food banks in communities like yours<U+0097>are working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families who<U+0092>ve fallen on hard times. But even as demand has spiked, donations have slowed. Their incredible efforts are worth supporting if you can. https://t.co/kSdijlyHLH. The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society <U+0096> and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. https://t.co/eyy3dC22Ze. In moments of crisis, we look out for one other.

This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance<U+0097>structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures.

While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus<U+0096><U+0096>before it's too late. https://t.co/Eb2Hz8H8vU. We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids.

Parents, you deserve a break <U+0096> Michelle<U+0092>s got storytime handled every Monday. She<U+0092>s one of the best, I promise.

Through centuries of persecution, exile and struggle, the story of Passover has reminded the Jewish people<U+0096><U+0096>and all of humanity<U+0096><U+0096>of the power to overcome even the greatest of odds. Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to those celebrating with loved ones at home or virtually.. Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring <U+0096> something we have yet to put in place nationwide. https://t.co/evkTSrzReB. My advisor and friend @cecmunoz has been someone I<U+0092>ve turned to for years.

He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started<U+0097>that journey to justice.. What a joy it was to watch him pray and preach. I took heart in him saying, <U+0093>We ain<U+0092>t going back.

Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet<U+0092>s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she<U+0092>s unafraid to push for real action.

"AOC","after","@nichcarlson Some people have jobs where they can stay home if given pay. Restaurants, for ex - if we cover small biz expenses &amp; paychecks, we can take care of small biz &amp; people for a safe reopen.

Essential workers who can<U+0092>t stay home (warehouse wkrs, healthcare, etc) still need protections. If you want to know why COVID relief is tied up in Congress, one key reason is that Republicans are demanding legal immunity for corporations so they can expose their workers to COVID without repercussions.

Dems don<U+0092>t want you to die for a check. That<U+0092>s what we<U+0092>re fighting over.. @mcuban I don<U+0092>t say this to point fingers, but if we only say <U+0093>shame on both<U+0094> &amp; don<U+0092>t actually drill down to see *what* is holding things up then it<U+0092>s just performance

Right now GOP is demanding a full liability waiver for corps so they can expose workers to COVID w/o repercussion. @mcuban Pelosi compromised &amp; accepted the $4 trillion leveraged Wall St bailout the GOP demanded as a condition for passing the 1st stimulus check in CARES.

It was (&amp; is) a horrible deal that will structurally slant our economy against small biz for a long time. But she did accept it. @mcuban The fact that the Senate<U+0092>s not passing IS the problem. They need to pass a bill so there<U+0092>s a marker to negotiate w/.

Pelosi can pass 10 diff versions, it doesn<U+0092>t matter if the Sen passes nothing.

Thats why ppl don<U+0092>t know what<U+0092>s going on: Senate has 0. That<U+0092>s on Senate leader.. @mcuban @tedcruz When McConnell actually brings the Senate into session and passes a bill, then we can have a Senate version and a House version to reconcile and move forward. But they haven<U+0092>t done that. House has passed two. Senate is sitting around. https://t.co/Pn12PekDF3. @mcuban @tedcruz With respect @mcuban, this is not a <U+0093>both sides<U+0094> situation. The Senate literally skipped town. They<U+0092>re not even trying.

As much as it makes people feel good to say <U+0093>a pox on both your houses<U+0094> the fact of the matter is it<U+0092>s a one-sided situation trying to escape accountability.. @jeremyoharris Of course! Thank you so much. Seeing your play was at the top of my list before COVID hit, and I<U+0092>m looking forward to experiencing it one way or another soon :) Can<U+0092>t wait to hear your ideas.. You know in the House, when we don<U+0092>t have the votes to pass something, we work on the bill until we pick up the votes to pass it. That includes GOP votes - &amp; yes, GOP have voted for my leg too.

The Senate should try it sometime! People are going hungry as you tweet from vacay. https://t.co/INdMqmx1xr. With COVID upending life as usual and winter around the corner, we<U+0092>re going to need each other now more than ever.

Lobbyists don<U+0092>t ever sit back &amp; give admins <U+0093>a chance.<U+0094> #1 mistake is thinking our democracy is <U+0093>set it &amp; forget it<U+0094>. I hope someone else runs Cruz<U+0092>s Twitter account because it<U+0092>d be pretty embarrassing if a US Senator didn<U+0092>t know this.

Almost as embarrassing as when Sen. @JohnCornyn didn<U+0092>t appear to know that Puerto Ricans don<U+0092>t get to vote in the Presidential. The House doesn<U+0092>t have filibusters, @tedcruz.

We also passed several COVID relief packages to the Senate that not only include &gt;$500 billion, but also prioritize helping real people as opposed to Wall St bailouts the GOP tries to pass off as <U+0093>relief.<U+0094>

Nice try though <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD> https://t.co/X4YIdiXh5y. It is also a truly embarrassing indictment of what<U+0092>s considered <U+0093>center<U+0094> politics in the US that objecting to the appointment of an official who helped cover up the murder of a Black child is deemed the <U+0093>progressive, far left<U+0094> position. https://t.co/h94LjF6bHB. What is so hard to understand about this?

Rahm Emanuel helped cover up the murder of Laquan McDonald. Covering up a murder is disqualifying for public leadership.

This is not about the <U+0093>visibility<U+0094> of a post. It is shameful and concerning that he is even being considered. https://t.co/P28C0E4fYP. I know it<U+0092>s hard, but please consider your loved ones. Stay home if you can.

A negative COVID test does not clear one for safe travel. You can be asymptomatic &amp; test positive shortly after. You can get it en route.

Don<U+0092>t spread COVID to parents, loved ones, workers. Stay in!<U+0001F3E1> https://t.co/PPcUR6wtEb. People across the country are going hungry, COVID is set to explode, and Mitch McConnell dismissed the Senate last week.

I don<U+0092>t know how these people can sleep at night. I really don<U+0092>t.. Does anyone believe Rittenhouse would be released if he were Muslim &amp; did the same thing in a diff context? For people who say <U+0093>systemic racism doesn<U+0092>t exist,<U+0094> this is what it looks like: protection of white supremacy baked deep into our carceral systems.

Law and disorder.. People who argue that dramatic changes to policing, including budgetary ones, will mean <U+0093>violent people will be let out of jail to roam free<U+0094> rarely ever acknowledge that<U+0092>s actually the current system we have today for the privileged https://t.co/MXnm6h3PdZ.

It<U+0092>s rank hypocrisy and corruption. Incompetence at best. We shouldn<U+0092>t tolerate it.. .@KLoeffler disclosures show you seem to have gifted yourself private jet on public dime &amp; exploited corrupt tax loopholes to do it.

If you<U+0092>re happy helping yourself to public funds, maybe take a seat before arguing against stimulus checks to help everyday people in a pandemic. https://t.co/ZlhL2DjzpB. Utterly embarrassing that this woman was a governor &amp; still doesn<U+0092>t have a grasp on public investment. Wonder if she says federal financing works like a piggy bank or household too?

All this faux-seriousness from folks who worship Trump for running the country like his casino <U+0001F644>. Nikki, I<U+0092>m suggesting Republicans find the spine to stand up to their corporate donors &amp; vote for the same measures they did in March, except without the Wall St bailout this time.

And I know you<U+0092>re confused abt actual governance but police budgets are municipal, not federal. https://t.co/GCyUagbruG. <U+0093>Taking out Wayne County<U+0094> includes <U+0093>taking out<U+0094> the entire city of Detroit, AKA the #1 city in the US when it comes to African American population by percentage.. Translation of the Republican Party stance: <U+0093>We can undermine the election by stripping Black Americans of their civil rights.<U+0094> https://t.co/mpMM0AjBUF. Funny how you didn<U+0092>t hear Republicans complain about <U+0093>spending other people<U+0092>s money<U+0094> or ask <U+0093>how are we going to pay for it?!<U+0094> when they insisted on creating a $4 trillion leveraged slush fund for their Wall Street buddies in March. <U+0001F914>. Republicans are mad at this when they literally just voted to do just this in March.

The reason they<U+0092>re opposed to it now is because last time they got a Wall Street bailout and this time all that<U+0092>s left is helping working people, the disabled, the poor, etc.. Strange that you now oppose checks to help people survive shutdowns, Chip.

You voted YES for the CARES Act in March, which paid folks to help weather the impact of COVID shutdowns.

What changed for you to oppose stimulus now? The fact that there<U+0092>s no Wall St bailout anymore? https://t.co/ZxuzMk4kH3. 30 million people in this country are at risk of eviction.

Millions of people are unemployed or underemployed from cut-back hours.

The economy is not the stock market. We are NOT doing fine. People need help in red states and blue, &amp; our job is to help everyone. This is basic. https://t.co/M9NwZPGp2p. @MoveOn And a very brave one. @MoveOn and @DFAaction were some of the only organizations who stood up to intense political pressure from the party to endorse me in my first run. And this is proof!

I<U+0092>ll never forget it. You all are REAL ONES.<U+261D><U+0001F3FD> Thank you.. Does that year end plan include stimulus checks and UI extension?

Or did Meadows &amp; McConnell forget the part where millions of people desperately need help right now? https://t.co/oTfuosE3PU. If you say <U+0093>socialism<U+0094> three times in a mirror, a corporate lobbyist-backed candidate grows their wings <U+0001F47C>. Does the fleets thing stress anyone else out? Like I use Twitter to get away from IG stories, not have it follow me around on every platform reminding me that I don<U+0092>t have makeup on. <U+0093>Things were bad for me, so they should stay bad for everyone else<U+0094> is not a good argument against debt cancellation - student, medical, or otherwise. #CancelStudentDebt. When #BlackLivesMatter  first emerged as an activist call, many pundits called it a divisive movement that required <U+0093>too much explanation.<U+0094>

It was widely considered <U+0093>too controversial<U+0094> to say for YEARS.

It<U+0092>s wild how quickly people willingly forget that. It just happened.. We should also push for tuition-free public colleges to avoid this huge debt bubble from financially decimating ppl every generation. It<U+0092>s one of the easiest progressive policies to <U+0093>pay for,<U+0094> w/ multiple avenues from a Wall St transaction tax to an ultra-wealth tax to cover it.. @chimeracoder I was driving down to DC that day and had to pick something up before leaving (I switched to an EV for my DC commute due to COVID and safety reasons. Volume of threats grew tremendously before the election).. Can we please get people stimulus checks and mortgage relief and rent forgiveness and small business support and free testing and hazard pay and healthcare for the uninsured (&amp; underinsured) in the middle of a pandemic or is that too socialist too?. This is what can happen when we work together on a strong relational organizing &amp; digital strategy <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/OKoXcdj6ZU. .@MaxRose4NY has been a great colleague &amp; friend, despite all our differences.

He was relentlessly attacked for attending a community event after the murder of George Floyd.

Max used his election night speech to bravely declare why it was the right thing to do.

Watch it <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/LhWvBxv9lf. @alexnazaryan @Cliff_Michel No - we think it<U+0092>s wrong that our backend strategy (grassroots, relational organizing plus sophisticated digital) was ignored, not that they should have adopted our messaging.. Update: Holy cow - we surged to $280k for the GA grassroots last night!

That<U+0092>s some #EmbraceTheBase ENERGY right there. Keep going! <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/CZV8uDPZRV. Georgia isn<U+0092>t a red state. It<U+0092>s a voter-suppressed state.

Last night #TeamAOC mobilized to raise $100k *directly* to grassroots orgs @fairfightaction, @NewGAProject,&amp; more.

Time to charge forward &amp; support the folks leading the way.

Let<U+0092>s kick it up: https://t.co/w1F2d7pUFV https://t.co/bqWA8p84xj. @davidscottjaffe <U+0001F49E> please give your daughter my thanks. Stories like hers create the inspiration and energy to keep going. Thank you for sharing with me!. The idea that politicians can control activist messaging doesn<U+0092>t make sense. They don<U+0092>t work for us.

Our job is to listen and develop our message, own it, win,&amp; lead. Civil rights movement didn<U+0092>t poll well at the time either. MLK was disliked. Does that mean he wasn<U+0092>t effective?. This was a call from communities that unfolded in real-time. Activists don<U+0092>t focus group. BLM is not the DNC. It<U+0092>s a pols<U+0092> job to own their message.

Btw, it was effective-NYC is shifting to mental health workers at some 911 calls &amp; policies changed faster than an election cycle. https://t.co/Bz6MQEwRiV. Pretty astounding that some Dems don<U+0092>t believe it<U+0092>s possible to govern, be politically popular, and command formidable bully pulpits at the same time, but it actually explains a lot about how we got here. https://t.co/mP2tXgr40I. Thank you to each and every one of our veterans for your sacrifice and service.

Words are never enough on #VeteransDay or any day. The best way we can show gratitude is with our actions. https://t.co/iYoTjIjJb2. You can also thrift and buy second hand online, which helped me get higher quality, longer-lasting things that would normally be out of budget. Good luck!!. Thrifting, renting, and patience as you get your closet together sis. Capsule wardrobe will be your best friend. @AyannaPressley has the accessory game down

Good news is that all these practices are very sustainable and good for the planet! <U+0001F609> https://t.co/X4Cyy8HOwF. I hope people realize that the same Republicans who are refusing to acknowledge the results of our elections also champion disastrous foreign policy claiming they<U+0092>re <U+0093>bringing democracy<U+0094> to other nations.. Alas, I<U+0092>m just a first term Congresswoman, standing in front of a government, asking it to love working people. If I were actually as all-commandingly powerful as Republicans say I am, everybody in this country would have guaranteed healthcare by now. https://t.co/R2bHiMP4Rs. Again, neither of us is saying GOP messaging didn<U+0092>t hurt. And no one is telling folks in tough seats to adopt activist messaging.

We are saying the messaging hurt to the extent that it did because our operations &amp; investments are not great and it makes the party vulnerable.. For the Dems who think I<U+0092>m just being a selfish, divisive bombthrower from a deep blue seat, maybe you<U+0092>ll listen to Doug Jones in Alabama when he says the same thing <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/nSa3GhpeeR. @coachbenalbert I agree! Prioritizing state legislatures and fighting for census integrity are critical to changing this entire dynamic - the entire House being gerrymandered for GOP favorability has shifted both parties to the right.. @kurteichenwald @christoq My district is 75% working class people of color, so I<U+0092>m pretty sure they are part of the Dem base.

Also you<U+0092>ve publicly made a big show of unfollowing and disengaging, so why are you still all up in my mentions upset for pointing out our party isn<U+0092>t on the internet in 2020?. @JakeSherman (To be fair, with all the caucus leaks from day 1, speaking in the caucus is largely acknowledged as pretty much speaking in the media - just indirectly.). Except the argument here isn<U+0092>t ideological- are purple communities not on the internet? You can run a moderate message &amp; not change it at all &amp; my message still applies.

Dems must run like it<U+0092>s 2020, not like it<U+0092>s 2005. That has nothing to do with ideology. It<U+0092>s about capacity. https://t.co/XhGbzs9Cmo. As Bronxites do I went to Orchard Beach to celebrate and this lady said over the speaker <U+0093>traiga la agua bendita porque Joe Biden is president<U+0094> <U+0001F602><U+0001F1F5><U+0001F1F7><U+0001F1F5><U+0001F1F7><U+0001F1F5><U+0001F1F7> https://t.co/rJOx1VaRvE. Trump routinely targeted some of the popular &amp; respected movements &amp; figures - both politicians and non politicians- bc the right wants Dems to run away from our strongest assets.

Strategy can be nuanced &amp; we<U+0092>re a big tent, but we don<U+0092>t have to run scared all the time. Be proud!. I<U+0092>ve been thinking so much of @IlhanMN.

Trump made Minnesota explicitly about HER. Said he<U+0092>d win because of her. Many Dems in DC believed him, &amp; marginalized her.

That burden wasn<U+0092>t fair, but she took on the challenge anyway. She won.

Credit and respect her. @RashidaTlaib too.. John Kasich, who did not deliver Ohio to Dems, is saying folks like @IlhanMN, who did deliver Minnesota, are the problem.

Please don<U+0092>t take these people seriously and go back to celebrating and building power <U+0001F389> https://t.co/kXAv3UfmgQ. I saw party consultants take over a Congressional swing campaign operation this year and was it wasn<U+0092>t good.

The blind impulse to blame activists and the left both demoralizes a key constituency and distracts from asking real Qs &amp; fixing serious operational issues.. One thing I<U+0092>ll say: for the last two years, I and progressive candidates have been unseating powerful Dem incumbents supported by DCCC.

Not *once* has anyone in the party asked me what weaknesses I<U+0092>ve found in their operation.

If they stop blaming progressives, we can help.. Every single swing-seat House Democrat who endorsed #MedicareForAll won re-election or is on track to win re-election.

Every.<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD> Single.<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD> One.<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD>. Anyone saying this after immigrant organizers delivered AZ, Black grassroots flipped Georgia, MI going blue w reality-bending 94% Detroit margin + @RashidaTlaib running up the margins in her district &amp; Trump publicly challenging @IlhanMN in MN and losing isn<U+0092>t a serious person. https://t.co/2FtJzqGki8. BTW I<U+0092>m definitely happy to be proven wrong. If we can get independent data that @ProjectLincoln<U+0092>s videos and billboards were directly responsible for really effective R <U+27A1><U+FE0F> D persuasion - $67 million of it - I<U+0092>ll publicly apologize. But we just haven<U+0092>t seen any.. And for folks who think it persuaded Republicans, I<U+0092>d be interested to see data on how effective their videos and NYC billboards were at persuasion. Especially data that justifies $67,000,000.

It<U+0092>s not that persuasion doesn<U+0092>t work, it<U+0092>s a Q of if this was persuasion at all <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/yP38L5R1gC. @AndrewBeatty It<U+0092>s not the general <U+0093>Never Trump<U+0094> message that<U+0092>s a failure per se, but the kind of videos they made are pretty well shown to not be persuasive for a Never Trump message. Explicitly insulting anti-Trump content isn<U+0092>t what gets people to move. If anything it digs their heels in.. There<U+0092>s potential incentive bc @ProjectLincoln is def in scam territory w these results. It<U+0092>s a pretty  bad rep even tho GOP has a thing for failing up.

Come clean, say <U+0093>listen, we thought it<U+0092>d work, it didn<U+0092>t,&amp; in good faith we<U+0092>re gonna raise X mil for these ppl who deserve it<U+0094>. And if they spent it all (yikes) then they should consider using their fundraising juggernaut to get resources to those orgs.. It<U+0092>s not too late for them to do the right thing. Lincoln Project should take the L and publicly pledge to give a lot of their fundraising to the people who actually made a big difference. https://t.co/kW7mJMF5IF. Lol at the <U+0093>party of personal responsibility<U+0094> being upset at the idea of being responsible for their behavior over last four years. Is anyone archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future? I foresee decent probability of many deleted Tweets, writings, photos in the future. These members deserve a lot of props. They took a risk based on their values, gut, &amp; experience, &amp; didn<U+0092>t let themselves get bullied out of cosponsorship.

There<U+0092>s a myth that progressive leg doesn<U+0092>t win swing seats. But that<U+0092>s what it is: a myth. And it<U+0092>s time we called it that. https://t.co/Diht5Q8WsV. It<U+0092>s not an accident that Kelly spent by FAR the most on FB out of Senate challengers the week before the election &amp;was 1 of the main breakthroughs.

Hickenlooper who also won had solid digital too.

It<U+0092>s not the only factor, yet a big lost opportunity for some. Treat it like TV. https://t.co/OvS6Ms0url. @finetimetoleave @joncoopertweets Not sure if you read what I wrote above. Messaging absolutely matters - and the attacks are more decisive when there<U+0092>s no deep canvassing happening. Does your family<U+0092>s elected officials normally have year-round deep canvassers in their community?. And btw I<U+0092>m happy to cede ground on things that aren<U+0092>t working in some areas! But finger pointing is not gonna help. There<U+0092>s real workable &amp; productive paths here if the party is open to us.

(After all, I got here by beating a Dem who outspent me 10-1 who I knew had bad polling). You can<U+0092>t just tell the Black, Brown, &amp; youth organizers riding in to save us every election to be quiet or not have their reps champion them when they need us. Or wonder why they don<U+0092>t show up for midterms when they<U+0092>re scolded for existing. Esp when they<U+0092>re delivering victories.. By the way if white communities are getting more comfortable w overt racism or <U+0093>cultural resentment<U+0094> (if that<U+0092>s what they<U+0092>re rebranding it now) it<U+0092>s only gonna get harder for POC turnout to save everyone.

Real organizing &amp; strategy is needed that disarms bigotry, not avoids it.. And on this hand-wringing about slight POC increases for GOP in some areas - this is also an area w answers.

But honestly when it comes to Latinos the party<U+0092>s just never seriously made an effort. Mexicans, Central Am, Caribbean, Chicanos - Cubans are not the only impt community. How do you make it less effective? Invest in year-round deep canvassing. Data shows that this kind of work helps blunt the force of racial resentment at the polls.

If you<U+0092>re always running away from convos about race, then the only ppl owning it are GOP. You<U+0092>ll lose.. So the whole <U+0093>progressivism is bad<U+0094> argument just doesn<U+0092>t have any compelling evidence that I<U+0092>ve seen.

When it comes to <U+0093>Defund<U+0094> &amp; <U+0093>Socialism<U+0094> attacks, people need to realize these are racial resentment attacks. You<U+0092>re not gonna make that go away. You can make it less effective.. There are swing seat Dem incumbents who cosponsored the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, etc and if I<U+0092>m not mistaken every single one won re-election.. Also, the decision to stop knocking doors is one people need to grapple with and analyze.

@IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib never stopped and may very well have helped delivered a Biden Presidency bc of it https://t.co/5nweAADmIF. Ideology + messaging are the spicy convos a lot of people jump to but sometimes it<U+0092>s about execution and technical capacity.

Digital execution was not good, polls were off, ironically DCCC banned the firms who are the best in the country at Facebook bc they work w progressives!. Underinvestment across the board. Some campaigns spent $0 on digital the week before the election. Others who spent did so in very poor ways.

If I spent only $12k on TV the week before an election &amp; then blamed others after, you<U+0092>d ask questions. That<U+0092>s how it looks seeing this.. There are folks running around on TV blaming progressivism for Dem underperformance.

I was curious, so I decided to open the hood on struggling campaigns of candidates who are blaming progressives for their problems.

Almost all had awful execution on digital. DURING A PANDEMIC.. What they have done - from @staceyabrams &amp; @fairfightaction to @ConMijente and the whole underrecognized legion of organizers- is nothing short of remarkable. Give them their flowers <U+0001F490>. People need to really look at the communities who delivered these miraculous victories in AZ, GA, MI, MN, etc. They are rarely a focus of traditional political investment or electoral strategy,&amp; are often sacrificed in policy negotiations.

One <U+0093>thank you<U+0094> would be changing that.. @AyannaPressley @Gisella_serene @gisella_serene Always start with listening. Spend lots of time listening to the people you<U+0092>re running to champion, studying solutions, and staying true to yourself. Don<U+0092>t shrink yourself. Be brave. And never harden your heart when things get tough <U+0001F49C> you got this. Who have been some of your favorite grassroots organizers, orgs, collectives, initiatives, etc that have been inspiring you lately? <U+2B07><U+FE0F> <U+0001F490>. Why do we listen to people who lost elections as if they are experts in winning elections?

Many of our hospital workers can barely speak about the trauma of 1st COVID spike.

Same for home healthcare aides, who opened doors visiting patients not knowing if they<U+0092>d be alive or not.. It<U+0092>s not normal for people to handle this much human loss.

The more college costs soar, the more degrees become a measure privilege than competence. Our country would be better off if we made public colleges tuition-free &amp; cancelled student loan debt..

As much as GOP cry about <U+0093>elites,<U+0094> they<U+0092>re the ones who constantly mock food service workers, people w/o degrees, etc as dumb.

So when people donate on my side, it yields real benefits for people &amp; the party. When GOP hate-donate, they just set money on fire.. You can see how corrupt it is when you break down spending.

In NY14, GOP is spending on TV, mailers, etc (consultants get a cut of this)

In contrast, we did a $1M census outreach effort that<U+0092>ll bring in ~$53M in federal funds for the next 10 years &amp; defend # of NY House seats.. One perk about a GOP motivated by hatred is that it<U+0092>s irrational and unstrategic.

Thanks @IlhanMN, @pokimanelol, @hasanthehun, @DisguisedToast, @mxmtoon, @Jack_Septic_Eye, @Hbomberguy, @DrLupo, @Valkyrae, @Gusbuckets, @Corpse_Husband, @MoistCr1TiKaL &amp; @israhirsi https://t.co/L02lZwWpjz. Join me, @pokimanelol, @hasanthehun, &amp; more on Twitch TONIGHT as we help folks make a voting plan at https://t.co/TskRLfhCt3 and officially declare orange sus on Among Us <U+0001F34A>

Tune in 9pm tonight at https://t.co/nZap5fuerN https://t.co/HeKMeDDjXf. Don<U+0092>t worry everyone - I haven<U+0092>t streamed yet! Spent tonight setting up accounts, mods, streaming &amp; run throughs. Hoping to go live tomorrow night<U+0001F91E><U+0001F3FD>. So @exxonmobil &amp; friends, care to tell us the end of this story?

Did you coordinate the $25 million? https://t.co/0YI5VhWYzS. Is the plan to withdraw Barrett<U+0092>s nomination?

Because if not, I<U+0092>ve got the world<U+0092>s tiniest violin at the ready <U+0001F3BB> https://t.co/20cSwh6qM3. Anyone want to play Among Us with me on Twitch to get out the vote? (I<U+0092>ve never played but it looks like a lot of fun). @AlxThomp @allymutnick @MaxRose4NY Ah yes, the classic limousine liberal trope of not wanting 12 year olds to be targeted to complete military recruitment forms on video game platforms. FYI, Republicans aren<U+0092>t <U+0093>free market capitalists<U+0094> either.

They just believe in spending billions in public resources to boost their friends, prizes to big corps over mom + pops, &amp; taking a cut for themselves instead of investing in public services like healthcare and education. https://t.co/jYKE1fgwxK. Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes!

I am so deeply grateful for the support, love, friendships, and communities we<U+0092>ve made together.

Here<U+0092>s to another year of making a better world. <U+0001F382>

&amp; Let<U+0092>s keep masking up so we can go back to hugs &amp; smooshing faces- love you all! https://t.co/cHlXlQun5k. When politicians use faith as an excuse to pass and uphold laws that seize control of people<U+0092>s bodies but not guarantee them healthcare, feed the poor, shelter the homeless, or welcome the stranger, you have to wonder if it<U+0092>s really about faith at all.. Genuine question for the media / law enforcement: why are you calling these armed neo-nazi groups breaking the law <U+0093>militias<U+0094> instead of <U+0093>gangs<U+0094> or <U+0093>domestic terrorist groups?<U+0094>. Journalists:<U+0093>How do you feel about the Green New Deal<U+0094> is not a climate change question.

Try: <U+0093>What is your plan to bring down emissions?<U+0094> so voters actually understand if a candidate even *has* a plan for the worst impending crisis of our time, and can share what it is.. I still can<U+0092>t get over how bad the climate change section of the debate was last night.

This is the consequence of no climate questions in debates for years.

The questions were childish, no follow-up questions for basic information, &amp; there was almost no talk of solutions.. Just to be clear: there is nothing <U+0093>pro-life<U+0094> about denying people comprehensive sexual education, making birth control harder to access, forcing others to give birth against their will, and stripping them of healthcare and food assistance afterwards.. Pence demanding that Harris answer *his* own personal questions when he won<U+0092>t even answer the moderator<U+0092>s is gross, and exemplary of the gender dynamics so many women have to deal with at work.. Why is it that Mike Pence doesn<U+0092>t seem to have to answer any of the questions asked of him in this debate?. The Green New Deal is and has been lied about nonstop, and yet is STILL popular.

It<U+0092>s a massive job-creation and infrastructure plan to decarbonize &amp; increase quality of work and life.

It<U+0092>s okay to call the GOP out on those lies just as we call them out on all their other lies.. Today in my IG story:

How the Black Panthers<U+0092> People<U+0092>s Free Food Program led to Free &amp; Reduced School meal policies nationwide (and inspired #TeamAOC<U+0092>s COVID food relief operation in 2020) <U+0001F957> https://t.co/tfjNq3kiZ8. For all the partisans who think PR statehood automatically = 2 Dem seats: think again.

Puerto Rican politics is incredibly complicated bc it isn<U+0092>t on a Dem-GOP spectrum like the US.

It<U+0092>s colonized. The sole DC Rep caucuses w/ GOP. We need decolonization, not status imposition<U+0001F1F5><U+0001F1F7> https://t.co/8XHcdxEbLT. What an anti-everybody agenda looks like:

The President &amp; GOP are walking away from getting ANY COVID stimulus relief done, effectively endangering millions, after *they* themselves got COVID &amp; enjoyed free socialized healthcare, so they can push through an anti-ACA SCOTUS pick. https://t.co/zIidL1d6Rr. .@TulsiGabbard - You, along with everyone else who amplified this fraudulent story, owe Rep. Omar a public apology. https://t.co/20FHctFFFs. That<U+0092>s if the GOP can even sustain a quorum.

If not, Dems can call roll and potentially delay proceedings - and we should.

We shouldn<U+0092>t give McConnell an inch. Every minute matters. https://t.co/ROAE6OOv7e. There<U+0092>s no questionnaire about symptoms, no requirement to report to the House physician if we are experiencing symptoms, no temperature check upon arrival to DC, nothing.

Then we all get on planes and travel back to our communities, often twice a week. It<U+0092>s dangerous.. 400-500+ members of Congress regularly travel from every corner of the country to DC &amp; back.

Each time we convene carries with it the potential of a superspreader event.

It<U+0092>s absolutely unacceptable that there is no regular temp-taking, testing, or contact tracing protocol. https://t.co/kMdujmNGmJ. I must say, Ted Cruz making poorly executed memes while riding in the quiet car of the White Supremacist Express is pretty on brand for both him and 2020 https://t.co/cqWKxHFKs9. Listen to @AyannaPressley.

The President is many awful things, but when people use diagnoses &amp; treatments such as ADHD as insults, they aren<U+0092>t insulting 45 as much as they hurt the millions living with these conditions - many of whom you likely know, but may not be aware of. <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/wqEfBrztxy. Donald Trump is a white supremacist.

People have been warning about this for a long time.

They were ridiculed, called hyperbolic &amp; radical - not bc they were wrong, but bc others couldn<U+0092>t accept that our country elected a supremacist as President.

This is fascism at our door. https://t.co/sahloCJt25. This isn<U+0092>t news, Kellyanne.

Our differences are exactly why I joined Biden<U+0092>s Climate Unity Task Force - so we could set aside our differences &amp; figure out an aggressive climate plan to address the planetary crisis at our feet.

Trump doesn<U+0092>t even believe climate change is real. https://t.co/Bj8SMD9Syf. When Republicans talk about the Green New Deal being 100 trillion dollars, please know they<U+0091>re doing that Dr. Evil thing where they shout random, escalating numbers to sound ominous.

See for yourself. It<U+0092>s written so you don<U+0092>t need a law degree to read: https://t.co/clcSqyQDqy. Can we please stop calling it <U+0093>the issue of race<U+0094> when what we<U+0092>re really discussing is <U+0093>the issue of racism<U+0094>. Someone call el chacal de la trompeta on Chris Wallace because this is very much an <U+0093>y fuera<U+0094> situation. One major promise that Trump *did* keep was to run the country like he ran his business.

Unfortunately for us that means incompetently, fraudulently, and rife with bigotry + corruption <U+0001F4B8> https://t.co/ibx8rzxlhF. The nerve of people who ask <U+0093>how are you going to pay for it?<U+0094> whenever we propose building advanced public education, healthcare, &amp; climate infrastructure yet defend a system where Trump pays $750 in taxes and Amazon pays none is beyond me.. You can learn more and take a deep dive on voting &amp; money in politics with @voxdotcom<U+0092>s Whose Vote Counts, Explained: https://t.co/2wLxvAgw2U. Money doesn<U+0092>t have to buy your vote.

Each time you look past the flood of TV commercials, scammy Facebook posts and angry mailers to verify the claims you see &amp; think critically, you help fight the corrupting tide of money in politics.

Here<U+0092>s how <U+2B07><U+FE0F>
https://t.co/TkHTr9zr7C. Last year Republicans blasted a firehose of hatred + vitriol my way because I treated myself to a $250 cut &amp; lowlights on my birthday.

Where<U+0092>s the criticism of their idol spending $70k on hairstyling?

Oh, it<U+0092>s nowhere because they<U+0092>re spineless, misogynistic hypocrites? Got it. https://t.co/xCQGwW7EK5. In 2016 &amp; <U+0091>17, I paid thousands of dollars a year in taxes *as a bartender.*

Trump paid $750.

He contributed less to funding our communities than waitresses &amp; undocumented immigrants.

Donald Trump has never cared for our country more than he cares for himself. A walking scam. https://t.co/VZChbp8htu. @alexbkane Hey there - this event and my involvement was presented to my team differently from how it<U+0092>s now being promoted.

Thanks for pointing it out. Taking a look into this now.. @justinamash Thanks @justinamash, I know how seriously you take your service and restoring the integrity of our legislative process - means a lot.. Sen. Feinstein<U+0092>s protection of the filibuster is unjust &amp; unacceptable.

The filibuster wasn<U+0092>t made w/ purpose. It<U+0091>s the result of an accident in rulebook revision &amp; bloomed as a cherished tool of segregationists.

Now it empowers minority rule. That<U+0092>s not <U+0093>special,<U+0094> it<U+0092>s unjust. https://t.co/anKwCSbQWb. Congressional GOP have made one thing extremely clear:
To them, there are no rules.
There are no principles.
There is only power.

They are ruthless, and always have been in my lifetime.

Dems must recognize they cannot be reasoned with at present &amp; better adapt to that reality. https://t.co/DPq6xj61fF. Don<U+0092>t worry Mrs. Greene, I completely understand why you need to swing + miss at my intellect to make yourself feel better.

You seem to have some trouble spelling your own insults correctly.

Next time try <U+0093>single-handedly,<U+0094> it<U+0092>ll work better.

Good luck writing legislation! https://t.co/y33JXVfxDc. All our rights are on the line.

To protect them, everyday people must mobilize in unprecedented ways to keep the SCOTUS vacancy open &amp; win back the White House + Senate.

Meanwhile, the House &amp; Senate must consider using every procedural tool available to buy the country time. https://t.co/z9aGIHTBCz. 3 Reasons the GOP want to take RBG<U+0092>s Supreme Court seat:

1. To gut your healthcare
2. Take away your birth control &amp; control of your body
3. To further dismantle our civil rights https://t.co/ZIMXf8dVco. And after we work to command victory in November, I need folks to realize that there<U+0092>s no going back to brunch.

We have a whole new world to build. We cannot accept going back to the way things were, &amp; that includes the Dem party. We must deliver transformative, material change. https://t.co/r7du2yOl2c. Here<U+0092>s what we<U+0092>re NOT gonna do: give up.

We don<U+0092>t give up when people need us most. That<U+0092>s not who we are.

Our democracy is at a faint heartbeat; it was broken even before Trump. But so long as we can save lives, I believe we have an obligation to do so as we build a new world. https://t.co/QBGqflpihC. You do not need to, nor should you, ignore your fears - there is plenty to be afraid of - but we have possibilities before us.

We can win, we can succeed, but we cannot do it alone. We will need the people.

We must get to work.
Everyone matters.
Everyone has something to give.. Our first, no 1 priority is to do everything possible to secure electoral college victory in Nov. 

This is the fight of and for our lives. That has always been true, &amp; it becomes more true each day.

Opponents of democracy need your resignation to succeed. Don<U+0092>t give it to them.. Now is not the time for cynicism or hopelessness. There is and continues to be political possibility to preserve our democracy &amp; move forward.

It will require each &amp; every one of us, from the streets to the Senate, to grow in courage, strength, and strategy. But it is possible.. We have lost a giant in the history of our nation with the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

It is heartbreaking that in her final moments she was, as are many others, preoccupied with what would happen after her passing.

I want to make one thing clear: we can, and must, fight. https://t.co/QEDDFtSwmK. Believe me, I too wish that a little carbon tax here &amp;a little fuel efficiency there would solve this.

There was a time in the early 90s where those policies could<U+0092>ve made an enormous difference. But our leadership failed &amp; ran out the clock. Now we need WWII-level mobilization.. It<U+0092>s almost as if the climate crisis was punted for so long due to fossil fuel lobbyists &amp; weak political leadership that it<U+0091>s exploded to become so large + lethal that we now need a massive infrastructure &amp; jobs plan to decarbonize the economy on a rapid timeline

#GreenNewDeal https://t.co/Nda7IHdobw. Some days I wake up &amp; it seems there<U+0092>s 500 GOP wannabes pitching themselves as the <U+0093>anti-AOC.<U+0094>

First of all, as Republicans y<U+0092>all don<U+0092>t have the range.

Secondly, most of you are just afraid to run against your actual Dem opponent. It<U+0092>s lazy. Work harder. https://t.co/rMMQOSo3lG. NYC taxi drivers were targeted in an enormous predatory lending scheme for city-issued medallions, creating horrifying financial desperation that has cost lives.

Last year I questioned witnesses regarding the predatory lending crisis &amp; they agreed - this debt must be cancelled. https://t.co/YYHzhq6upR. Hey you!

You matter. You count.

And we need to count YOU to determine the next 10 years of school funding, elected representation, and so much more.

Please take 5 minutes right now to fill out your census and pass on to your friends: https://t.co/Yug5BgrWYg https://t.co/gbxjNMBq8j. <U+0001F48C> My @USPS stamp haul today:

1. Succulent Boutonniere stamp
2. Thank You gold foil stamps
3. Earth Day forever stamps https://t.co/ouYARyXmMw https://t.co/aVsCp5iBHV. Aggressive, overreaching wealth redistribution *does* happen in the United States, it just happens in the opposite direction conservatives scream about: our system takes money away from everyday people and siphons it towards the profanely wealthy. <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/O4KqY3Z8Fz. It wasn<U+0092>t just the right wing.

The reason I didn<U+0092>t choose a more comfortable term for <U+0093>targeting &amp; detaining groups largely by ethnicity w/o trial in camps w/ malnutrition, sexual assault, permanent psychological trauma + bodily harm<U+0094> is bc we shouldn<U+0092>t be comfortable about it. https://t.co/0A7zIgvdCg. Cannabis should be legalized &amp; records should be expunged ASAP.

It<U+0092>s strange that the more conservative step of decriminalization is seen by some as too controversial or <U+0093>risky.<U+0094>

Each day we postpone is a day we let communities be ravaged &amp; profiled. It must end. #LegalizeIt https://t.co/axFMm1f3fT. It<U+0092>s astounding that after a massive family separation operation, mass sexual assault of detainees, trapping immigrants in COVID-infected detention centers, and now reports of mass hysterectomies (which the US has done before), abolishing ICE is controversial.

Where<U+0092>s the line?. The fact of the matter is the United States has engaged in a program of mass human rights violations targeting immigrants.

This includes mass child separation, systemic sexual assault of people in detention, kangaroo-court procedures, &amp; more.

Our country must atone for it all. https://t.co/KaacDaww5t. The HEROES Act the House passed months ago covers several (but not all) of these points.

GOP Senators, pledging allegiance to Mitch McConnell, have intentionally sat on this bill &amp; did nothing.

People are starving. Babies are sleeping on car floors. Where is the needed urgency?. Mass evictions could be prevented if Congress prioritized struggling people 1/2 as much as it prioritizes Wall St bailouts.

It<U+0092>s never too late to help people w/:
- rent + mortgage relief
- 2nd stim check
- UI extension
- Emergency state &amp; local funding
- Expand Medicare
&amp; more https://t.co/1C8WbAkA89. @AyannaPressley Can we talk about this collar jewelry!! The lip color! Are you glowing up without me?! <U+0001F923> whew, I<U+0092>m taking notes <U+0001F4DD>. Ever notice how primary challenges from progressives are derided as <U+0093>divisive<U+0094> and <U+0093>bad for the party,<U+0094> yet folks are oddly silent about how the center/conservative wing of the party just spent millions trying to unseat me, Ilhan, Rashida, &amp; Ed Markey?

Funny how that works.. If the USPS is surprised we are issuing a subpoena, it<U+0092>s because they weren<U+0092>t listening.

I said directly in the hearing that if DeJoy didn<U+0092>t quickly hand over documents, we should issue a subpoena.

They knew the consequences of stalling. Now, where<U+0091>s his unaltered calendar? https://t.co/raNrSytmz6. On a personal note, when I first got to Congress the reception I got in many spaces was v chilly.

Ed Markey wasn<U+0092>t afraid. He offered his expertise &amp; partnership. He wasn<U+0092>t scared of big policy &amp; didn<U+0092>t use kid gloves.

It<U+0091>s great to watch him overcome the odds and win tonight. https://t.co/lFjlu4AUiQ. Congratulations @EdMarkey - yours is a victory for the progressive movement, for 21st century policy, and for the Green New Deal <U+0001F30E>

THANK YOU to every single voter, supporter, organizer, grassroots donor, &amp; everyday person who helped make this happen. This win belongs to you <U+0001F49A> https://t.co/pzzr8IAuH2. MA: Let<U+0092>s run up the NUMBERS for @AyannaPressley<U+0092>s re-election today!

Get yourself &amp; your family to safety now if evacuation orders cover your area.

This hurricane is on a devastating path. The arriving storm surge is being deemed <U+0093>unsurvivable<U+0094> by @NWSNHC. https://t.co/7ILS03Hhtb. (And btw - if they give a substantive answer to open a conversation, great! But words matter a great deal in moments like these, and we shouldn<U+0092>t simply repeat them without giving real thought to understanding why). For media outlets and journalists choosing to use the word <U+0093>boycott<U+0094> over <U+0093>strike,<U+0094> we should ask them to explain why.. NBA players are courageously on strike (withholding labor), NOT boycotting (withholding their $ /purchase). The diff is important bc it shows their power as *workers.*

The courage this takes is profound. WNBA organizing in this moment MUST be recognized too. #StrikeForBlackLives https://t.co/QfsJAHLVLx. .@NydiaVelazquez, the first mujer Boricua in the House, &amp; I co-wrote this piece about PR political status if you<U+0092>d like to read more.

https://t.co/PHFj49LSW9. Say it with me: the issue of DC &amp; Puerto Rico statehood are not <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD> the <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD> same.<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD>

PR is a colony of the United States.

Justice isn<U+0092>t the colonizing country deciding fate for the colonized. It is the people<U+0092>s decision.

The word is self-determination, not statehood. <U+00A1>Gracias! <U+0001F1F5><U+0001F1F7> https://t.co/Mt5jPET31w. @KaleighRogers Normally I would agree, but this instance went far, far beyond a tweet - the article, headline, etc repeated the frame and reposted across multiple social networks and their own website SEO. The woman the GOP picked as their <U+0093>proud<U+0094> Latina to tout <U+0093>immigrant experience<U+0094> didn<U+0092>t seem to know that Puerto Rico is already part of the United States.

It<U+0092>s quite on message, bc it reflects their belief that Latinos aren<U+0092>t real citizens, even when we are Native descendants. https://t.co/I7iU3yEGT0. Here is my new mascot proposal:

Progressives take elephants from Republicans, bc they are compassionate, empathetic creatures w nuanced social structures. 

General Dems can keep Donkeys if desired - we can unite under that tent.

Republicans are Honey Badgers. These women are my lifeline. I wouldn<U+0092>t have been able to survive this first term without their sisterhood.

Thank you @VanityFair for giving us &amp; 22 activists space to champion Black maternal health, housing, civil rights and economic justice for all. https://t.co/OaE9eySCnh https://t.co/b1RWNeNIgg. Praying for Jacob Blake, his children, and his family.

It<U+0092>s not enough to paint slogans. We need systemic change: ending qualified immunity, changing budget priorities, investing in communities harmed by overpolicing, and more.

The solutions are out there. We must act on them.. @liamkerr It<U+0092>s not a departure. I can still believe those things and find them consistent with what I<U+0092>m saying here.. The House passed a second stimulus &amp; UI extensions months ago.

Republicans have abandoned the process bc they got their big corporate bailout wish in CARES. Wall St was/is their main priority, so now they have no incentive to come back to the table to help people. It<U+0092>s shameful.. (My answer: I host one per month minimum. Pre-COVID, I rotated locations between the Bronx &amp; Queens. These days we do all-digital ones that you can join via Zoom and later find on YouTube). How often does your member of Congress (House or Senate) host town halls?

Have you ever gone to one?. Happy Friday! Beauty is political.<U+0001F484>

Thanks @voguemagazine for a conversation on what it means to work a red lip on Capitol Hill.

Get ready with us at the full video link below <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/Ah0zQ3jaS0. @AlxThomp If I had a second for every time someone said X got more time than me I<U+0092>d pool them together and give them to @JulianCastro. Ed Markey earns people<U+0092>s support bc he is a Senator who actually uses his power and privilege to advance change, instead of denigrating, watering down, or finger-wagging the community leaders demanding it.

I cannot communicate enough how rare a quality that is in Washington. https://t.co/IIF8vNCuum. Wow, really heartbroken to hear what a guy who thinks <U+0093>windmill cancer<U+0094> is a thing thinks about my climate policy.

Anyways check out our Green New Deal plan for Public Housing, we worked w/ scientists, building trade workers &amp; NYCHA residents to write it: https://t.co/E8xOYR0QAS https://t.co/kqFuxw98gz. @TaylorLorenz It<U+0092>s easy to say <U+0093>don<U+0092>t read the comments,<U+0094> but that<U+0092>s nearly impossible when part of your job is engaging the public w/ your work.

If you<U+0092>re going to do it, try to look for substantive responses &amp; don<U+0092>t get stuck in bad faith stuff.

Your reporting is impt &amp;has taught me a lot!. Ilhan<U+0092>s multimillion challenge was bankrolled by DC lobbyists &amp; dark money groups.

He blatantly admitted to using shell corporations to get around the DCCC blacklist, which all but means his vendors work w/ the Democratic Party.

Yet DCCC hasn<U+0092>t enforced policy. I wonder why <U+0001F914>. No one gets to complain about primary challenges again. <U+0001F917>

So @dccc, when can we expect you to reverse your blacklist policy against primary orgs?

Because between this &amp; lack of care around @IlhanMN<U+0092>s challenger, it seems like less a policy and more a cherry-picking activity. https://t.co/xSneSK8H2q. All the heinous things that Bannon is responsible for and it<U+0092>s a GoFundMe page that does him in.

We need massive investment in our country or it will fall apart. This is not a joke. To adopt GOP deficit-hawking now, when millions of lives are at stake, is utterly irresponsible.

Hold the line. Win. Lead. https://t.co/UsCYddHv15. .@NBCNews still hasn<U+0092>t apologized.

It doesn<U+0092>t matter how big a <U+0093>legacy brand<U+0094> a news division has, this kind of manipulative behavior is dangerous &amp; needs to be checked.

We saw what happened in <U+0091>16. This recklessness will easily extend to the Dem ticket if it doesn<U+0092>t stop now. https://t.co/zBe7rGGQAh. I am taking this seriously because we have seen this recklessness before in <U+0091>16.

We have seen click-hungry media coverage bring voters to a froth for no reason but views.

It was me this week, but they will do it to Kamala, Biden, or anyone else next week. It needs to stop now.. Yes. NBC<U+0092>s misleading headline, which had thousands of people confused and angry, wasn<U+0092>t a mistake. It was clickbait.

It wasn<U+0092>t just a tweet, either. It was repeated in other headlines &amp; posts.

@NBCNews still hasn<U+0092>t apologized. As stated here, this is on their entire news team. https://t.co/oV12mFitci. Yes! So many people haven<U+0092>t gotten this yet.

As wonderful as they are concerts, meme attempts, even the presence of younger politicians alone isn<U+0092>t what activates young people<U+0092>s votes.

Policy commitments do. Young voters should be recognized &amp; respected as any other electorate. https://t.co/OB7gokK4z2. Powerful, moving, history in the making.

We are going to put in every ounce of work and effort we have to make you our next Vice President, @KamalaHarris.

And you will be an incredible one. https://t.co/117HTChA3b. Love it. And love her remarks on the crucial role of childcare in economic life and the interwoven threads of our economy.

Thank you, @ewarren! https://t.co/HsusqCBnaz. These horrifying ICE reports are not one-off incidents.

ICE, like many unjust structures, is not <U+0093>broken.<U+0094> It is operating in the logical conclusions of its founding.

ICE is structured for dehumanization. Experts warned abt this in its creation in <U+0091>03.

Another way is possible. https://t.co/QRgkowUlId. If you believe people have to go to an elite university to know what racism, classism and xenophobia are, maybe that is a reflection of *your* class/race experience more than it is anyone else<U+0092>s.

Working class people are just as perceptive as the privileged. Oftentimes more so. https://t.co/6eYMGpnHxC. So @NBCNews how are you going to fix the incredible amount of damage and misinformation that you are now responsible for?

Because a 1:15am tweet to slip under the radar after blowing up a totally false and divisive narrative across networks isn<U+0092>t it. https://t.co/zf6Wqiotvv. This is completely unacceptable, disappointing, and appalling.

The DNC shared the procedural purpose of my remarks to media WELL in advance. @NBC knew what was going to happen &amp; that it was routine.

How does a headline that malicious &amp; misleading happen w/ that prior knowledge?. You waited several hours to correct your obvious and blatantly misleading tweet.

It sparked an enormous amount of hatred and vitriol, &amp; now the misinfo you created is circulating on other networks.

All to generate hate-clicks from a pre-recorded, routine procedural motion. https://t.co/crDlEymgMD. Congratulations, @JoeBiden - I deeply look forward to fighting for our future together and reclaiming our democracy in November.

Thank you @DemConvention for having me deliver Sen. Sanders<U+0092> roll call nomination speech.

It<U+0092>s been an absolute honor.
#NotMeUs &amp; #Biden2020 <U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8> https://t.co/dJN1FUQfix. If you were confused, no worries!

Convention rules require roll call &amp; nominations for every candidate that passes the delegate threshold.

I was asked to 2nd the nom for Sen. Sanders for roll call.

I extend my deepest congratulations to @JoeBiden - let<U+0092>s go win in November. <U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8> https://t.co/uI92P3UfLn. Congress gave the airline industry billions in bailouts under the guise of preserving good, dignified jobs in this pandemic crisis.

This money isn<U+0092>t for CEO pay, stock prices, or to pad profits. It<U+0092>s for workers.

I hope @JetBlue makes good on this contract that workers deserve. https://t.co/j2zZ1DgbK8. If I can regularly roast Trump sycophants in 280 characters or less, I can speak to progressive values in 60 secs (&amp; maybe filibuster a few extra <U+0001F609>).

Meanwhile, you<U+0092>re supporting GOP sabatoge of people<U+0092>s medicine, votes, etc by mail bc apparently democracy means nothing to you. https://t.co/Y3hYhpfOuK. We can build bridges &amp; not lose sight of our values.

It<U+0092>s important to remember that Kasich is an anti-choice extremist. He 100% will (and has) signed away our reproductive rights the moment he has the opportunity to do so. He is not a friend to workers.
https://t.co/7S8504VZcK. It<U+0092>s great that Kasich has woken up &amp;realized the importance of supporting a Biden-Harris ticket. I hope he gets through to GOP voters.

Yet also, something tells me a Republican who fights against women<U+0092>s rights doesn<U+0092>t get to say who is or isn<U+0092>t representative of the Dem party. https://t.co/38h6JGpbMj. I am not one to plead - I organize.

But the GOP lack of urgency here is costing lives. Missed insulin, no formula, babies &amp;families sleeping on car floors or in the elements.

We can solve this problem. Please table your demands for corporations aside for a moment &amp; feed people.. .@senatemajldr, @MarkMeadows, @tedcruz, @SenatorCollins, Trump, the whole @GOP -

Please read this and see how many millions of Americans are in this or similar positions. The pain is unspeakable.

Please have mercy for them. Let<U+0092>s extend $600 UI &amp; send a second round of checks. https://t.co/YIJShsITM0. NYPD union endorsed Trump. I<U+0092>m sure this is part of their neighborhood outreach plan.

Also, does anyone else see a potential problem with police unions - enforcement arms of the state with lethal weapons - promoting <U+0093>preferred<U+0094> candidates for office or is that just me? https://t.co/UlmigAuedh. Hey, you!

I know there<U+0092>s a lot going on. But one way you can REALLY help political representation is by filling out your Census.

If you have, get your friends + family to do it, too.

It<U+0092>s okay if you lost the code in the mail. Fill it out here: https://t.co/85Zq2Nhs48 https://t.co/wl5EZ49PUg. @koush One freshman member cannot reconvene the entire House, launch a large scale investigations, etc alone. But Congressional leadership can.

What I can do is voice my readiness to pursue a plan of action, address this emergency, and head back now if that is what<U+0091>s necessary.. It<U+0092>s not a coincidence that the GOP advanced tropes about non-citizenship to President Obama, Reps. Tlaib, Omar &amp; Pressley, &amp; now Sen. Kamala Harris; especially in moments of power.

Implying poc <U+0093>don<U+0092>t belong<U+0094> in our country is one way of protecting a white supremacist vision.. Whether it<U+0092>s <U+0093>where<U+0092>s the birth certificate?<U+0094> to <U+0093>send her back!<U+0094> to <U+0093>where were her parents from?<U+0094>- these contrived claims (which are almost never levied at white US officials born abroad) catch on bc the supremacist idea that poc are inherently less legitimate has deep roots.. White supremacy is a belief system based on the idea that ppl of color, esp Black ppl, are fundamentally illegitimate as equal citizens or human beings.

Calling into question the citizenship of elected officials of color, esp when the answer is obvious, is one way it manifests.. It<U+0092>s not just Trump that<U+0091>s destroying the US Post Office.

It<U+0092>s the entire Republican Party.

Senate &amp; House GOP could easily override a Trump veto of postal funding and help oversight.

Well, you<U+0092>re in luck!

TONIGHT @JabariBrisport &amp; I are hosting a workshop on how to safely organize a community childcare collective.

Live Spanish translation &amp; CC provided.

RSVP: https://t.co/mqhyvDe67J https://t.co/f4HUbmxx0s. I want folks to recognize how big of a triumph @IlhanMN<U+0092>s victory represents.

Tens of millions in big money was targeted to unseat 3 of us as <U+0093>safe<U+0094> Dems - almost unheard of.

This is what happens you deeply challenge systems of power and corruption. But the people triumphed. https://t.co/adVnV6wGGR. Minnesota:

Today is primary day, and a wonderful day to re-elect Ilhan Omar!

Ilhan<U+0092>s progressive national leadership has brought transformative approaches to healthcare, housing, and more.

Head to the polls and remind your friends and family to vote as well. <U+0001F5F3> https://t.co/CpmDEPRGq8. Another reason we need real economic support for families (extended UI, stimulus checks, payment relief, etc) is to make school reopening plans w/ the purpose of maximizing public health, rather than sacrifice peoples<U+0092> lives to fuel an economy that doesn<U+0092>t even value theirs.. If it<U+0092>s not safe enough for indoor dining, what makes it safe enough for indoor schooling?

(...and restaurants actually have soap in the bathrooms). This direct aid has benefited over 40 diff efforts, from food distribution w @hungrymonknyc to helping immigrant families excluded from the CARES Act w/ @NYSYLC &amp; @VendorPower.

In a just society, none of this would be necessary. But we<U+0092>ll do everything we can until we get there.. As federal response continues to be insufficient, our supporters have been stepping up to help families ourselves.

I<U+0092>m proud to announce that #TeamAOC has raised over *$1 million* in direct aid to people - all from small dollar, grassroots donations. https://t.co/1rzwcCqCZX. Our Fall series of #TeamAOC Organizing workshops are here!

Zuckerberg himself said he<U+0092>d go <U+0093>to the mat and fight<U+0094> against these points.

Could that include weaponizing FB<U+0092>s platform to influence our elections? https://t.co/Z5tPm9D52W. Remember when I asked Zuckerberg why he allowed a white supremacist-linked org to be an official fact checker for Facebook and he wouldn<U+0092>t give a straight answer?

Maybe this is why: Facebook<U+0092>s right-wing radicalization funnels are looking increasingly intentional &amp; designed <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/AGaQwR6g3E. @stevenjfrisch This account is labeled as a <U+0093>campaign<U+0094> account bc I engage in advocacy on it.

My governmental account is @RepAOC, where I share our legislative efforts, public announcements, etc..

Rather shocked &amp; very grateful.

Please watch it here:
https://t.co/IMCtS86VXG https://t.co/EYvVR3hnen. Just as purveyors of misinformation are constantly testing new techniques, so should we in verifying info.

Not everything we try is going to work. Is a ban on political ads the best route? Prob not. But at least there<U+0092>s a willingness to recognize how dangerous misinfo is &amp; act.. I appreciate that Twitter is a platform that<U+0091>s at least *trying* to stop disinformation, verifying news outlets, etc.

Stopping misinformation isn<U+0092>t abt sitting around for years debating ideas.

It<U+0092>s about testing tactics, trying ideas, etc to find what<U+0092>s effective. https://t.co/O213ih0Rof. Two years ago, three out of the four  women running grassroots campaigns in @knockdownmovie lost their primary election.

She didn<U+0092>t <U+0093>survive<U+0094> - she *overwhelmed* at the polls.

Throughout our first term, we<U+0091>ve been told our advocacy is <U+0093>too much<U+0094> to be re-elected.

Instead, voters supported her in huge margins.
https://t.co/ckF1I9zSBr. Absolutely incredible.

Congratulations, @CoriBush - YOU accomplished this w/ the people of Ferguson &amp; #MO1.

You<U+0091>ve shown that the power of grassroots, mass-movement politics is stronger than gatekeepers &amp; big money - it<U+0092>s about advancing the tide of justice whose time has come. https://t.co/mYOZKxitEW. Pretty nauseating how easily Congress rubber stamped a $4 trillion dark slush fund for Wall St as <U+0093>COVID relief,<U+0094> yet somehow $600 for workers in pandemic is controversial.

Up close it<U+0092>s staggering how much resistance there is in Washington to actually helping people directly.. .@NationalNurses in my community CONSTANTLY communicate how housing is a major determinant of health.

A wave of evictions + housing instability means yet another crush on our healthcare system.

We must do whatever we can to guarantee housing during this pandemic (&amp; overall!) https://t.co/6fiCGIoEW5. @padrealberto @YourFavXtian Greetings - I have in fact made several statements about this clip being intentionally manipulated out of context, &amp; those who misled abt what I said. My statements can be easily found on my Twitter feed or in reports on the matter.

Hope you all are doing well and staying safe!. It is ironic that many claiming to <U+0093>defend<U+0094> a saint no one attacked approached this matter w/ such lack of grace or generosity.

Instead of examining for truth, many jumped to irrational conclusions &amp; sprung to cast judgement &amp; condescension w/o engaging the actual idea presented. We have 100+ statues and portraits in the Capitol. Almost all of them are of white men.

Every single statue there could be of a canonized saint and that *still* doesn<U+0092>t change the fact that the erasure of women &amp; BIPOC from American history is a feature of white supremacy.. Yep.

At no point did I say Fr. Damien was a bad figure - in fact, I explicitly stated that my observations weren<U+0092>t about litigating his or any individual statue.

It<U+0092>s about the fact that a huge supermajority of statues in the Capitol are white men. Barely any women or BIPOC. https://t.co/son0SZ2HVS. Military recruitment forms are being sent out to children on gaming platforms.

The forms can be filled out by kids as young as 12 years old, and include consent to be contacted by a recruiter.

Although my amendment to end this practice failed, have a conversation w/ your kids. https://t.co/NOMqaB3xIh. @johnrobertgage Frankly this isn<U+0092>t even a hard point to understand, especially for a journalist. 

It<U+0092>s also clear you understood this point well enough to identify the relevant context in the video and deliberately erase it in an effort to stir up controversy.. @johnrobertgage 1. Unsure why you cut the context of the video. Here<U+0092>s moments prior

2. Read the text of the video you posted: it<U+0092>s not about litigating an indiv person or statue, but examining that the TOTALITY of all 100+ statues are almost all white &amp; male,incl to rep largely nonwhite places https://t.co/624zJ11jU1. The good news: a majority of the Dem party supported this amendment.

That<U+0092>s a really solid start for this being the first time this issue has been brought before Congress.

We<U+0092>ve made great strides since *that* Senate FB hearing, but we<U+0092>ve got a lot of room to still improve!. When our legislative bodies aren<U+0092>t sufficiently responsive to tech, then that means we don<U+0092>t have the tools required to protect people.

This is partially why companies know way more about you than you may even be aware of - bc it<U+0092>s legal, and Congress is struggling to keep up.. Some context for a few folks getting upset at this: Congress is voting on legislation regarding Twitch today.

It<U+0092>s totally fine if you don<U+0092>t know what Twitch is. But tech literacy is becoming an growing need in Congress so we can legislate to protect people<U+0092>s privacy, etc.. This is awesome.

So often young people are told to contact their legislator, but it<U+0092>s hard to know if a call or tweet made a difference.

Thank you @RepTedDeutch for not only supporting this amendment, but showing how direct outreach can impact legislative outcomes! <U+0001F933><U+0001F3FC> https://t.co/ZOAFa8su7t. - War is not a game
- Twitch is a popular platform for children FAR under the age of military recruitment rules
- We should not conflate military service with <U+0093>shoot-em-up<U+0094> style games and contests

The Marines pulled out of Twitch for a reason.

It<U+0092>s time to follow their lead. https://t.co/eXOPyzTDDy. The root of the problem is not necessarily format. It<U+0092>s that there<U+0091>s so much pressure on members of both parties to spend time fundraising that it takes time away from deeply studying and preparing for hearings.

If you want hearings to be better, get money out of politics. https://t.co/Ir9WRz2vMi. I am happy to inform you that I<U+0092>ve already introduced an amendment to block your latest racist, classist nonsense https://t.co/AJbb5bL0VV https://t.co/upIwAZU95D. The main reason unemployment benefits are poised to expire on Friday is bc Trump<U+0092>s White House &amp; the GOP are refusing to extend them.

They seem to think people can be starved into taking 30 million jobs that don<U+0092>t exist.

This callous game playing w people<U+0092>s lives is horrifying. https://t.co/1q5AYnoc6u. @Chinchillazllla It<U+0092>s not a conspiracy, I tweeted it too early. This bill is part of a suite of leg that *includes* rent cancellation, it<U+0092>s not a replacement/sub for it.

We should do all of it, and any lawyers should be publicly funded too. The initial tweet implies a wrong context.. Our civil liberties are on brink.

This is not a drill. There is no excuse for snatching women off the street and throwing them into unmarked vans.

To not protect our rights is to give them away. It is our responsibility to resist authoritarianism. https://t.co/pw20WF05KK. Up to 40 million people could be evicted if the federal gov doesn<U+0092>t act boldly enough.

Right now, the risks of doing too little for COVID relief far outweigh the risk of doing <U+0093>too much<U+0094> for families.

People need rent + mortgage relief, 2nd stimulus check, &amp; extended PUA *now.* https://t.co/tvq1kYEmKP. Everyone who just donated $1 or more during my IG livestream just now has officially just done more for essential workers who are undocumented than Mitch McConnell has all year.

We hit over $60k for @NYSYLC tonight! Thank you! <U+0001F60C> https://t.co/kPHEhMyJa3. Thanks for bringing us together for an incredible conversation, @mPinoe!

It was wonderful spending time with you, @nhannahjones &amp; @hasanminhaj to discuss our present and future. https://t.co/QkZgGm2kn5. @tedlieu It<U+0092>s an honor to serve with you, Ted. Thank you for being an example to the world of how to be a decent man. <U+0001F49C>. Here is my full response regarding Mr. Yoho and the culture of misogyny that inspired his actions.

I am deeply appreciative of my colleagues and everyone speaking up and out against the rampant mistreatment of women both in Congress and across the country. <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/nFfxy5UdmP. This is incorrect reporting, @politicony.

Yoho<U+0092>s remarks were not directed to me. He did not mention my name, nor did he acknowledge that I was even involved.

You should take this down and correct it. https://t.co/ECfSZrZP1d. The irony about Yoho<U+0092>s excuse for his <U+0093>passion<U+0094> in accosting me is that he says he has a personal history w/ poverty, and took offense that I discussed poverty and crime.

So... he accosted me... to prove poverty doesn<U+0092>t result in traumatized behavior?

OK <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD> where<U+0092>s the apology https://t.co/BKzJa7KUBW. - Does not apologize or name any action he did
- Does not accept responsibility
- Lies (this was not a <U+0093>conversation,<U+0094> it was verbal assault)
- Distracts by making it abt poverty (ironically)
- Says everyone else is wrong and the incident never happened.

This is not an apology.. Republican responds to calling a colleague <U+0093>disgusting<U+0094> &amp; a <U+0093>f<U+0097>ing b*tch<U+0094> w/ <U+0093>I cannot apologize for my passion<U+0094> and blaming others.

I will not teach my nieces and young people watching that this an apology, and what they should learn to accept.

Yoho is refusing responsibility. https://t.co/BKzJa7KUBW. What<U+0092>s wild to me @RogerWilliamsTX is why would you blatantly lie to a reporter who saw this exchange?

You were yelling at me too, about <U+0093>throwing urine.<U+0094>. Gotta love Republican courage from Rep @RogerWilliamsTX: when he undeniably sees another man engaged in virulent harassment of a young woman, just pretend you never saw it in the most cartoonish manner possible and keep pushing.

(He<U+0092>s lying, by the way. He joined in w/ Yoho) https://t.co/TAjvXBdd9u. I never spoke to Rep. Yoho before he decided to accost me on the steps of the nation<U+0092>s Capitol yesterday.

Believe it or not, I usually get along fine w/ my GOP colleagues. We know how to check our legislative sparring at the committee door.

But hey, <U+0093>b*tches<U+0094> get stuff done. <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> https://t.co/WlG3xccwR7. So @kilmeade as a Fox News host are you going to take responsibility for spreading fabricated information about a sitting member of Congress or...? https://t.co/egSgAhncaz. Federal law enforcement officers should have their identifying information displayed while on duty.

This is basic.

@EleanorNorton and I have introduced legislation to make it law:
https://t.co/xcL1j15STo. There are simply no words to capture the enormous life and leadership of John Lewis. 

From his youth, John Lewis gave his blood, sweat, tears, and life in the struggle for a better nation.

To honor that gift is to fight for future generations, just as he fought for us. https://t.co/4OjSwfoXr8. Any budget that<U+0092>s balanced on working people<U+0092>s backs is a budget that will make inequality worse. Everyday families are going hungry. It<U+0092>s time to tax the rich.

Thank you @MaketheRoadAct for leading this fight along w/ @JumaaneWilliams, @jessicaramos, @yuhline, &amp; many others.. Did you know that there are 118 billionaires... in New York alone?

And that they<U+0092>ve made billions more during COVID?

Did you know that the very workers billionaires rely on are going hungry &amp; without healthcare?

This is wrong. If Trump cut their taxes, NY should pick them up. https://t.co/x5swN3cH43. Hey everyone - there seems to be a large Twitter attack right now targeting large accounts.

Please be vigilant about any bitcoins scams and do NOT click on any suspicious links.

Just in case, if my account tweets any bizarre links related to cryptocurrency, do NOT click on it.. Over 100,000 Americans are dead and Congress won<U+0092>t extend Medicare to the unemployed bc it<U+0092>s too busy protecting a corporate system that makes pandemics insanely profitable for Wall St.

This is what capitalist healthcare looks like, &amp; it<U+0092>s wrong. People shouldn<U+0092>t die for profit. https://t.co/s0qAWBI5zw. This man was experiencing homelessness, and left a crowded shelter.

Due to COVID, Tax Day this year was postponed to TODAY, July 15th.. A man whose entire life was built on a rich blend of daddy<U+0092>s money and financial fraud accuses me, daughter of a house cleaner who won multiple elections to Congress by the age of 30, of not having talent. <U+0001F923>

You can tell from his delivery that even HE doesn<U+0092>t believe it. <U+0001F602> https://t.co/blUMByAGjk. The House voted to send a 2nd stimulus check *2 mos ago* &amp; Senate Republicans haven<U+0092>t even discussed it.

For a party that pretends to care abt hard work, they are the laziest leaders in COVID.

Even House GOP work harder, &amp; they don<U+0092>t even read bills.

GET TO WORK @senatemajldr https://t.co/xf3Q5vq7KN. For those who say, <U+0093>she may ask, but won<U+0092>t get it<U+0094> - one reason she may not is bc of unusual public scrutiny here. Esp when public isn<U+0092>t looking, leniency for the wealthy happens all the time.

Epstein was given highly unusual accommodations for his violence until it grew public.. See? The rich make the case for prison abolition *for themselves* all the time (and often get it), incl for systemic violence, yet are never deemed <U+0093>radical.<U+0094>

It<U+0092>s only <U+0093>radical left<U+0094> when we ask our legal system to treat normal people 1/10000th of the way it treats the wealthy. https://t.co/4NiTaAJN9W. @FionnOnFire Won my promos on Sona, but I also play Janna, Lux, and Morg. Working on my Lulu, but it<U+0092>s not ready for prime time yet. I am deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Naya Rivera.

The talent and depth Naya brought to her characters inspired millions. As a Latina, it<U+0091>s rare to have rich, complex characters reflect us in media. Naya worked hard to give that gift to so many.

Que descanse en paz.. For example, I have heard employers say <U+0093>we already offer great benefits, why bother unionizing?<U+0094>

We offered great benefits too - many of which were ratified in our contract!

A union can also:
a) Protect these benefits, &amp;/or
b) Establish impt non-monetary rights &amp; protections. This whole process was really eye-opening &amp; I learned a lot!

As a nonprofit employee &amp; a waitress, I always worked in right-to-work places. Seeing the power of a union up close was inspiring.

I also gained insight into anti-union arguments, which is helpful for countering them.. From living wages to parental leave, it<U+0092>s always been impt to me that wherever possible, my campaign walks the walk.

I<U+0092>m proud to say that Team AOC is a union shop!

Some deets:

People who study crime know that (despite how many pundits pretend otherwise), *causes of crime are complex* and there are few neat and tidy causal relationships.. None of these policing reductions have even *happened yet.*

So a spike is happening WITH a $6 billion dollar NYPD budget.

You either know this &amp; are intentionally lying, or you<U+0091>re a bad spokeswoman &amp; haven<U+0092>t verified your claims.

Given your work with @NRA it<U+0092>s probably both. https://t.co/vHtq04ei86. It<U+0092>s our real life.

While it takes months, sometimes years to study crime data, I personally can tell you that fed &amp; state relief is NOT reaching people.

We aren<U+0092>t getting stimulus checks (mixed status fams), millions can<U+0092>t pay rent, &amp; summer youth employment has been cut. /7. I take this issue seriously. Unlike many of GOP pundits theorizing from suburban homes, I<U+0092>ve had multiple family members shot, shot at, stabbed, etc.

Crime + community violence isn<U+0092>t some thought experiment to project your thoughts &amp; theories abt communities you<U+0092>ve never met. /6. Mind you, there are entire TV series glamorizing, humanizing, and sympathizing White Americans in this exact situation of selling drugs to live - Weeds, Breaking Bad, etc.

But fact is, Black &amp; Brown communities have been in this predicament forever &amp; get called <U+0093>animals.<U+0094> /5. For Black &amp; Brown communities, especially in the era of criminalization, the choice to sell weed of course is a risky one - not just w/ police, but with those you get tied up with.

Yet when a teenage boy believes the other option is homelessness, they may take the chance. /4. It<U+0092>s virtually impossible to pay rent on $8/hr.

And when you are teenage boy in a fatherless home (his dad passed away), there is a drive to be <U+0093>the man of the house.<U+0094> To help your mom.

And what makes money fast when a full time job doesn<U+0092>t pay enough to live? Selling weed. /3. Let me give you a real life example that I<U+0092>ve encountered often (wording vaguely to protect people).

Growing up I was friends w/ a boy who was the son of a single mom. They struggled to pay rent.

As we know, hourly work doesn<U+0092>t pay a living wage - especially then. /2. Republicans are all upset that I<U+0092>m connecting the dots between poverty and crime.

I know most of them haven<U+0092>t experienced or seen these issues first hand, but I have.

This may be hard for them to admit, but poverty and crime are highly linked, both violent &amp; nonviolent alike. https://t.co/4t34dCLZlw.

Your habichuelas probably taste like your politics anyway: 0 saz<f3>n https://t.co/h21ZREFMTH. Many of the people actually <U+0093>cancelled<U+0094> are those long denied a fair hearing of their ideas to begin w/:

Palestinian human rights advocates

Anticapitalists
Anti-imperialists

Not spicy <U+0093>contrarians<U+0094> who want to play devils advocate w/ your basic rights in the NYT. I have an entire TV network dedicated to stoking hatred of me. A white supremacist w/ a popular network show regularly distorts me in dangerous ways, &amp; it<U+0092>s a normal part of my existence to get death threats from their audience.

You don<U+0092>t see me complaining abt <U+0093>cancel culture<U+0094>. The term <U+0093>cancel culture<U+0094> comes from entitlement - as though the person complaining has the right to a large, captive audience,&amp; one is a victim if people choose to tune them out.

Odds are you<U+0092>re not actually cancelled, you<U+0092>re just being challenged, held accountable, or unliked.. People who are actually <U+0093>cancelled<U+0094> don<U+0092>t get their thoughts published and amplified in major outlets.

Join me, @JamaalBowmanNY &amp; @housing4allNY for an eviction defense workshop:
https://t.co/B0fbfgCze6. Above all, I keep hearing that booming voice of our forever Chairman Elijah Cummings.

He had a mantra of sorts for us: <U+0093>be efficient and effective.<U+0094> He operated w/ precision &amp;was one of the best leaders I<U+0092>ve ever seen. A master. I hope he<U+0092>d be satisfied to see today<U+0092>s SC ruling.. What I love about the work of @OversightDems is that it<U+0091>s investigatory &amp; collaborative, w/ rippling effects.

It<U+0092>s slow work, but that<U+0092>s what makes it so gratifying - the committee will spend months, sometimes years laying groundwork that contributes to huge moments &amp; shifts. /2. One of my first hearings in Congress was of Michael Cohen, called in by Chairman Cummings.

Here<U+2B07><U+FE0F> Cohen testified that Trump manipulated his assets,&amp; that we need to see his taxes.

@OversightDems is some of my fav work in Congress. It<U+0092>s a slow burn, but yields major results. /1 https://t.co/zPongFKfc3. @mcbyrne Yes, each Task Force had varying space in which we were able to advance positions.

Ultimately, VP is the nominee &amp; will hold positions we disagree w/(or find baffling!).

But that<U+0092>s okay. The gains are great precommitments, the losses aren<U+0092>t veto threats-organizing can still win. Of course, like in any collaborative effort, there are areas of negotiation and compromise.

But I do believe that the Climate Task Force effort meaningfully &amp; substantively improved Biden<U+0092>s positions.

I encourage you to engage the document critically and offer feedback or Qs.. The Climate Task Force has agreed to elevate Biden<U+0092>s climate standards across the board &amp; adopt a whole-of-gov mobilization, incl:
- Ambitious construction, mass transit, &amp; transport, &amp; ag standards+investment
- Creating millions of good jobs
- Centering climate justice standards. Today the 6 Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces are unveiling final language.

The Climate Task Force accomplished a great deal. It was an honor to serve as co-chair w/ Sec. @JohnKerry.

Among the notable gains: we shaved *15 years* off Biden<U+0092>s previous target for 100% clean energy. https://t.co/pnLj7uufeg. Yes @GOPLeader, @IlhanMN has long been on the side of dismantling systems of oppression &amp; structural racism, as she stated.

It<U+0091>s revealing that *YOU* equated <U+0093>oppression<U+0094> w/ <U+0093>our entire system<U+0094> as you intentionally took a Black Congresswoman<U+0092>s words out of context to target her. https://t.co/8U00MDCZVP. Is it me, or is the GOP losing their touch with the conspiracy-theory-as-campaign-rhetoric technique?. Vanessa Guillen<U+0092>s family deserves justice.

What happened to her, and to so many victims of sexual harassment and assault in the military, is utterly unacceptable.

We need an independent investigation. Thank you @RepSylviaGarcia for leading the charge. https://t.co/ScubfNak9k. Maxwell<U+0092>s arrest is a significant development.

I hope the SDNY and all relevant parties have conducted an extensive review of the failures of Epstein<U+0092>s custody to ensure Maxwell<U+0092>s safety as this case bears out. https://t.co/5o5HqwJskO. Guess who<U+0092>s repeal of the Faircloth Amendment just passed the House! <U+0001F60C> 

Faircloth has blocked construction of new public housing in the United States for 20+ YEARS. Repeal is key to tackling our housing crisis.

THANK YOU to the advocates who<U+0091>ve worked so hard to get here. https://t.co/JkcJvNBr72. @iTeachGatsby Thank you so much, and thanks for being open to new perspectives. Grateful to have earned your support <U+0001F49C>. One of the ways the GOP articulates their racism today is their idea that some citizens are <U+0093>real<U+0094> people and others aren<U+0092>t.

This is the argument they make against DC statehood: that this largely Black community doesn<U+0092>t qualify as <U+0093>real people.<U+0094>

So from the start, tonight<U+0092>s race was important to me.

Tonight we are proving that the people<U+0092>s movement in NY isn<U+0092>t an accident. It<U+0091>s a mandate.. #TeamAOC volunteers made over 56,000 calls to NY14 TODAY. As in ONE DAY.

That<U+0092>s shattered all our previous one-day records.

If these politicians take money from police associations, how can they be objective about police budgets?. Teachers are paying out of pocket for school supplies, yet police are given extra tanks.

Budgets convey priorities.
We should question ours.. This is the issue w/ many <U+0093>reforms<U+0094>: yes, you can pass certain laws, but the problem is police *breaking the law.*

Check https://t.co/dVZwJAic7m to find your early polling location. https://t.co/BY0MMb9xDl. Charles Booker (@Booker4KY) is running for Senate &amp; building the kind of principled, inclusive, and winning coalition in Kentucky that can inspire positive change.

The US Senate will be a better place with him in it. I<U+0092>m proud to endorse him.

Let<U+0092>s go:
https://t.co/yocF7U9Os5. Not long ago, <U+0093>Black Lives Matter<U+0094> was *also* a rallying cry for justice that politicians worried polled too poorly, was too <U+0093>divisive<U+0094> &amp; required <U+0093>too much explanation.<U+0094>

Now Mitt Romney is saying it.

Progress is a process. It<U+0092>s normal to work through discomfort along the way.. @obrien Perhaps a bad choice to your aims &amp; focus

It<U+0092>s been an excellent choice for the organizers who have been trying to prompt a national convo for years about multibillion-dollar police depts.

<U+0093>Refund<U+0094> or <U+0093>reallocate<U+0094> didn<U+0092>t do that. <U+0093>Defund<U+0094> did. BLM had similar early resistance.. And by the way, the fact that ppl are scrambling to repackage this whole conversation to make it palatable for largely affluent, white suburban <U+0093>swing<U+0094> voters again points to how much more electoral &amp; structural power these communities have relative to others

Just for awareness!. Our job as policymakers is to take the public<U+0092>s mandate and find + create pockets to advance as much progress as possible.

Progress takes a team of different roles. You don<U+0092>t criticize a pitcher for not being a catcher.

We can respond in ways that don<U+0092>t undercut impt work. Lots of DC insiders are criticizing frontline activists over political feasibility and saying they need a new slogan.

But poll-tested slogans and electoral feasibility is not the activists<U+0092> job. Their job is to organize support and transform public opinion, which they are doing.. <U+0093>Defund<U+0094> means that Black &amp; Brown communities are asking for the same budget priorities that White communities have already created for themselves: schooling &gt; police,etc.

People asked in other ways, but were always told <U+0093>No, how do you pay for it?<U+0094>

So they found the line item.. Massachusetts: @EdMarkey is the real deal in the Senate.

He makes clear commitments over vague platitudes- a rare quality in a time when it<U+0092>s politically easier to do the opposite.

You are lucky to have him as a Senator,&amp; I hope you organize to keep him: https://t.co/1fYwHT2gZp https://t.co/JHfzV9Y57z. <U+0001F5F3> HOW TO VOTE IN NY:

Plan at https://t.co/dVZwJAic7m, absentee info below <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/e8DOglBGeT. The @PressSec comment is steeped in a long, hurtful, &amp; horrendous history of stripping women of color of titles and diminishing them to <U+0093>the help.<U+0094>

Perhaps she isn<U+0092>t aware that what she did is mired in racist history. If that is the case, I look forward to her apology tomorrow.. .@PressSec wouldn<U+0092>t be the first person to mistake a women of color  for having a lower position or title than she does, but Kayleigh - in case you haven<U+0092>t picked up a newspaper in two years, I<U+0092>m a Congresswoman. https://t.co/3FRHo7dpTL. Grassroots: <U+0093>We need major investments in healthcare, housing, and public education.<U+0094>

Conservatives: <U+0093>That<U+0092>s a nice idea, but fiscally irresponsible. You need to state how you<U+0091>re going pay for things!<U+0094>

G: <U+0093>Let<U+0092>s use money from overfunded police depts.<U+0094>

C: <U+0093>...not like that<U+0094>. Ayo, New York!

The movement for justice must show up EVERYWHERE, from the streets to the voting booth.<U+0001F5F3>

New York<U+0092>s primary elections are on JUNE 23RD.

Go to https://t.co/dVZwJAic7m to get your ballot.

Fmr public defender &amp; absentee expert @tiffany_caban will show you how<U+0001F609><U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/r74tbgdQy2. Wow.

This is a courageous example of the kind of material actions and commitments allies can make - shout out for walking the walk, @alexisohanian. https://t.co/Ku94GI04SY. .@MondaireJones is a deeply committed fighter for justice.

He<U+0091>s a people<U+0092>s champ rejecting corporate<U+0001F4B0> who belongs in Congress representing Rockland &amp; Westchester (where I went to public school!)

Let<U+0092>s rally around Mondaire. I<U+0092>m proud to endorse him: https://t.co/BtENIpBb7j. Civil liberties protect ourselves from governments using <U+0093>crises<U+0094> and <U+0093>emergencies<U+0094> as justification to dismantle our rights.

This is suspension of habeus corpus, it is unconstitutional, and it is deeply disturbing that both NYPD is seeking it and a judge rubber stamped it. https://t.co/t3K4EoNB6j. How injustices compound: Many protestors are people who<U+0091>ve lost health insurance during COVID.

After being beaten, tear gassed, or badly hurt, many are afraid to seek medical care to check for bleeds, fractures, or head injuries because they are newly uninsured.. @JBennet Other Qs: Did you consider the author<U+0091>s explicit call for violence (<U+0093>no quarter<U+0094>) when you chose to run this piece?

Is it your belief that you are not responsible for the factual integrity of what you publish?

Do you believe calling for violence is an <U+0093>opinion<U+0094>?. Can you explain why you chose to publish misinformation in your pages in service of an <U+0093>opinion<U+0094> for state violence?

Can you explain your choice to publish it on the anniversary of Tiananmen Square?

Do you believe your Black colleagues saying your choices have put them at risk? https://t.co/La67XY7TTx. Horrifying. You start with the tiny possibility that two officers may be walking over to deescalate the abusive one.

Instead, they join in beating a man trying to get out of traffic.

This isn<U+0092>t a problem of bad apples or incidents. This is an institutional and systemic crisis. https://t.co/eoBXXnNXZV. Not only is Jamaal a profound community leader, but I believe he<U+0092>d make a fantastic colleague in the United States House of Representatives.

Support his campaign for Congress here: https://t.co/110v6GXeVK. Jamaal has dedicated the last decade of his life serving his community as a school principal and community servant.

I could tell you all about him, but he tells his story better than anyone else.  https://t.co/36HhnlMWAl. This moment requires renewed and revitalized leadership across the country AND at the ballot box.

On June 23rd, New York will be holding primary elections.

Tomorrow I will be rolling out a slate of New York endorsements.

Tonight, I am endorsing @JamaalBowmanNY for Congress. https://t.co/vsCAeIi2kk. Yes, I will name names.

@amazon needs to stop integrating Ring cameras w/ police depts &amp; selling facial recognition tech to ICE.

@Nextdoor needs to publicly deal w/ their Karen problem

Commercial banks need to stop lobbying against the Community Reinvestment Act

Name yours <U+2B07><U+FE0F>. I see a lot of corporations releasing bland statements w a hashtag.

No. This moment calls for transformation.

Your statement should include your org<U+0092>s INTERNAL commitments to change, particularly if you<U+0092>ve been called on it before.

Give people change.
https://t.co/JvFpn2cMeA. As thousands hit the streets in NYC for justice, please make sure that you are caring for yourselves physically, mentally, and emotionally.

If you are regularly out w/ high exposure for ANY reason, please get COVID tested.

Testing is now free for all in NYC. As it should be. https://t.co/8xrolI5MaU. Goodbye, Rep. Steve King. You are certainly not the only white supremacist in federal government, but you were among the most prominent.

It<U+0092>s a shame Republicans held you up as long as they did.

SEE YA <U+0001F44B><U+0001F3FD> https://t.co/tymvh0hwLR. UPDATE: We are getting confirmation that the Brooklyn side of the bridge is now opening up.

You can get off there.

Stay safe everyone and get some sleep. https://t.co/heeCOSMVf1. UPDATE: Hearing from @JumaaneWilliams that the BK side is now opening up. People can get off on that side.

PLEASE stay safe, head home and get some sleep.. This is Bomba, a form of music &amp; dance in PR that centers our isla<U+0092>s Afro-Boricua history of strength &amp; resilience despite colonization and slavery.

Each performance is unique:  drummer and dancer improvise in response to each other. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta <U+0001F1F5><U+0001F1F7> por #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/kiyYfacmpG. CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, &amp; it very well may be one of the most dangerous.

They do NOT have oversight. Not even the measures local PDs have.

Their culture is toxic, they have 0 accountability,&amp; Congress gave them a blank check. This is dangerous.. Last year CBP officers circulated mockup images of my violent rape ahead of my visit to their facilities.

They hung framed photos of officers aiming guns at people on the walls.

Later that day,they refused to protect members of Congress when armed Trump supporters were outside. https://t.co/DdcYTSyZY1. For leaders enforcing a curfew, what plans are in place to protect ppl experiencing homelessness (yet another crisis disproportionately facing Black Americans)?

Genuinely wondering. Feel free to share what you see here.

Without a plan, the homeless will be subject to violence.. Happy Pride <U+0001F308>

Stonewall was started by Marsha P. Johnson, Black trans organizer rebelling against violent policing of LGBTQ+ people. She cofounded STAR w Sylvia Rivera for justice.

During COVID, discrimination against LGBTQ+ blood donors is especially cruel. Let<U+0092>s end it <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/Ko1vh2rHDi https://t.co/SPEWn1LGwl. True peace is the presence of justice.

Justice means recognizing and dismantling the violence of racial injustices in policing, housing, healthcare, pollution, wages, etc.

We need legislatures to step up now with POLICY changes.

In NY, repealing 50-a is one place to start. https://t.co/c8CRIl0z6Q. Last night the NYPD Sergeants<U+0092> union *publicly threatened the mayor<U+0092>s daughter* while they held her.

Indefensible.

If police budgets bought peace, the $6 *billion* NYPD budget would<U+0092>ve bought the most sophisticated de-escalatory operation in the world.

Clearly, it didn<U+0092>t. https://t.co/wjl8MG059w. A year ago, after CBP &amp; ICE violently kidnapped children from families &amp; traumatized thousands, a small # of us insisted that Congress giving them billions more money w/ 0 accountability was dangerous &amp; would have destabilizing effects.

We were belittled &amp; ignored.

Now this <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/6PMXDNRtMh. We followed up in hearings.

Repeatedly I was told this was a line that cannot be crossed despite clear, targeted violence that white supremacists are engaged in - bc the risks to civil liberties were too great.

The double standard is staring right at us.
https://t.co/DKjosMdjpt. I have questioned the @FBI in Congress as to why they don<U+0092>t use domestic terror labels for white supremacist groups.

They testified that the law prevents labeling US groups as terrorists, w/ severe civil liberties concerns.

Where is that concern today?
https://t.co/OHhkPrOKQu. Running SUVs in crowds of people should never, ever be normalized. No matter who does it, no matter why.. @NYCMayor your comments tonight were unacceptable.

As mayor, this police department is under your leadership.

This moment demands leadership &amp; accountability from each of us. Defending and making excuses for NYPD running SUVs into crowds was wrong.

Make it right. De-escalate.. We need rapid, real de-escalation and we need it right now. We cannot descend into the chaos of violence.

Please everyone, stay safe.. NYPD officers just drove an SUV into a crowd of human beings. They could<U+0091>ve killed them, &amp;we don<U+0092>t know how many they injured.

NO ONE gets to slam an SUV through a crowd of human beings.

@NYCMayor these officers need to be brought to justice, not dismissed w/<U+0093>internal reviews.<U+0094> https://t.co/oIaBShSC1S. Plenty of people can<U+0092>t be in the streets: disability, family care, etc.

But many are asking what we can do in this moment. We can ORGANIZE.

Join me right now@7 for a parent workshop on how to oppose a school-to-prison budget w/ @AQE_NY &amp; @MaketheRoadNY:

https://t.co/S15F4VxlzM https://t.co/BLPXDZWxRD. Important.

If you are at a demonstration and something doesn<U+0092>t seem right, this could be why.

Document it <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/FcYuAQeWJV. Congress often shies away from directly addressing police brutality.

But the 1st step to solving a problem is to name it. We cannot have a Congress too afraid to condemn brutality.

Call your member to cosponsor @AyannaPressley<U+0092>s resolution. Demand a floor vote. Yes, call Dems. https://t.co/G4ox92Cu8z. 3. What does mental healthcare look like in your city? Too often our prisons are used to discard ppl struggling w mental health, housing. Invest in the latter.

4. Healthcare, living wage, housing &amp; education guarantees. Without them we feed the cycle.

What are your ideas? <U+2B07><U+FE0F>. A lot of ppl are asking abt policy solutions. Here are a few:

1. Ask your mayor &amp; city council for strong Citizen Review Boards

2. Budgets. They<U+0092>re powerful. Find your city<U+0092>s police budget. Compare that to the school &amp; housing budget. More $ in fmr <U+27A1><U+FE0F> school-to-prison pipeline. Defunding afterschool programs to grow a $6 billion police budget is part of the problem.

Many NYers are asking what we can do in this moment. One major answer is to ORGANIZE.

Join me tonight for a parent organizing workshop w/ @AQE_NY on opposing education budget cuts in NY. https://t.co/NH7cIKrkM3. A Black New York State Senator (@zellnor4ny) and a Black NYS Assemblywoman (@YourFavoriteASW) were both pepper sprayed in Brooklyn today.

They were present as elected leaders to keep the peace and serve their communities.

Completely, utterly unacceptable. https://t.co/NoT8g4uAli. Huge update!

Our #SquadFund just blew past its $50k goal &amp; has raised $128k for frontline racial justice groups @BlackVisionsMN and @reclaimtheblock.

Thank you ALL for showing up. This will change lives. And I am thankful every damn day for sisterhood. https://t.co/3A53h4zTs4. If you work at Facebook and are inside agitating for change, thank you.

Don<U+0092>t let up.

Our democracy and the safety of so many lives are in the balance. Workers can tip it for the better.

Keep pushing everywhere. We see you. https://t.co/CeQ3nRzJTe. If you killed a man w/ health conditions, you still killed a man.

George Floyd couldn<U+0092>t breathe. 3 officers held him down, &amp; one w/ a recorded, violent history kneed his neck as others helped.

They waited 9 minutes for his last breath. This was not an accident. It was murder. https://t.co/aI5W6w7Vmt. Alright everyone.

Now is the time to step up for the frontline organizers who<U+0091>ve been engaged in the struggle for justice in Minnesota.

Join @IlhanMN, @RepPressley, @RashidaTlaib &amp; I in raising $50k for @BlackVisionsMN and @reclaimtheblock.

 https://t.co/QQwaXmdbtO. Police brutality + targeting Black communities: unjust

100k+ COVID deaths w/ disproportionate Black impact: needless

40+ million unemployed: unnecessary

Poverty: unnecessary
Homelessness: unnecessary
Low wages: unnecessary

None of this has to happen.
A new way is possible.. Now @VICE reporting that @CBP is sending predator drones over #GeorgeFloyd protests in Minneapolis.

This is what happens when leaders sign blank check after blank check to militarize police, CBP, etc while letting violence go unchecked.

We need answers. And we need to defund. https://t.co/tfBZFRNI9G. @CarIegend It<U+0092>s such a common and brazen practice to be told or <U+0093>encouraged<U+0094> to clock out while still being told to work.

The veiled threat is that you need to work for free or else you won<U+0092>t be able to work at all.. @OliverHidWoh Yes. This is why we pay our interns! It<U+0092>s worked out well: our interns are incredibly talented, brilliant, diverse, and come from working class backgrounds &amp; local community.

Our youth get a life-changing opportunity &amp; there<U+0092>s <U+0001F4AF> no way we<U+0092>d be able to do it if they were unpaid.. I<U+0092>m curious - how has wage theft shown up in your life? Have you ever had an employer steal your wages?

(Wage theft isn<U+0092>t just not receiving a check - it<U+0092>s being forced to do work off the clock, not being paid for overtime, being denied breaks, etc.)

Share your stories below <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/4SiyW1IzyE. I experienced it first hand as a waitress.

A manager forced me to clock out before I was done finishing my work, &amp; I couldn<U+0092>t leave.

When I spoke up about it, my schedule was changed to late, unusual, poorly tipping hours for a week.

(image source: https://t.co/gOgUrALX0R) https://t.co/QQE94wLCRo. Remember this?

Facebook<U+0092>s ties to white supremacy-linked orgs and sympathy for disinformation campaigns is not a small thing.

It is high level decision making, and appears to come from the top.

Rewatch this moment. Especially the end. It<U+0092>s relevant to what<U+0091>s unfolding now. https://t.co/VgFO8vQ9MY. Democrats should not allow FISA to proceed.

Congress should be fighting for people<U+0092>s rights, not the dangerous expansion of warrantless surveillance, nor exposing people<U+0092>s private browser histories w/o a warrant.

We shouldn<U+0092>t support it ever, and we *especially* shouldn<U+0092>t now. https://t.co/JC1qB4cD2X. Zuckerberg is not worried about being bullied by Trump.

He is worried that Facebook<U+0092>s PR operation is falling apart as it<U+0092>s exposed that their platform relies on white supremacists &amp; disinformation peddlers to be successful.

They aren<U+0092>t ignoring them. They<U+0092>re protecting them. https://t.co/DA4Fz6pc5q. Yep. When people are aghast and say we can<U+0092>t close prisons, I just tell them affluent suburbs already have. It look like this:

- good schools
- full employment
- default emphasis on alternatives to incarceration (ex. community service)
- healthcare, incl mental &amp;rehab
-  housing https://t.co/DbZBVurqF9. I<U+0092>ll just say it: a lot of politicians are scared of the political power of the police,and that<U+0092>s why changes to hold them accountable for flagrant killings don<U+0092>t happen. That in itself is a scary problem.

We shouldn<U+0092>t be intimidated out of holding people accountable for murder.. Gotta wonder how many of these US economic <U+0093>experts<U+0094> have been able to go their whole careers without ever having to take a course or study the history US racial wealth inequality. It<U+0092>s no wonder so many act as though poverty is either deserved or a policy accident. It<U+0092>s neither.. What<U+0092>s also wild is the arrogance of some of these folks saying it<U+0092>s <U+0093>wrong<U+0094> or <U+0093>ignorant<U+0094> for me to question the term <U+0091>Human Stock<U+0092> bc it<U+0092>s used in academia.

Plenty of awful terms have widely used without reflection. Over time language evolves to reflect evolved understanding. https://t.co/fXpkCypIRJ. Police shootings are now a leading cause of death for young men *across the board* in the US. For Black men and boys, the risk of being killed by police is *1 in 1,000.*

1 in 1,000. Terrifying and indefensible.

https://t.co/HLGXZAVOTp. #GeorgeFloyd should be alive. Instead, he was killed as he begged police for his life.

The impunity of police violence is a systemic problem we must face to save lives.

Police brutality is now a leading cause of death for young Black men in the US. The status quo is killing us.. Let<U+0092>s also not ignore the racial history of this terminology, which has roots in slavery. &amp;It<U+0092>s not just the terminology that<U+0092>s racialized.

Even today, the folks deemed as <U+0093>human capital stock<U+0094>(aka essential workers) are disproportionately Black, Brown, &amp; low income White folks. https://t.co/VO0lpCN1nP. Human Capital Stock.

An ugly term w ugly history, but for many powerful ppl it<U+0091>s their most honest view of workers: human stock.

By their logic, the moment a person stops being useful to profit motive (retirement, health, etc) they are a liability. That<U+0092>s the system we live in. https://t.co/ZihhtaI00W. Did you know?

There are 2 types of COVID tests!

The nasal swab<U+0001F443>tests if you have COVID now.

Antibody blood tests<U+0001FA78>check if you already had COVID, even w/ few or no symptoms.

I got my antibody test today at First Baptist in Queens w/ our amazing nurses. You can get one too! https://t.co/2XRyV1vbCU. Really great system we got here.

Can<U+0092>t imagine why anyone would question how beneficial or sustainable it is for the working class https://t.co/SiIX55NRX9. Wow: Norma McCorvey (aka <U+0093>Roe<U+0094> of Roe v Wade) revealed on her deathbed that she was paid by right-wing operatives to flip her stance on reproductive rights.

So, like many right-wing operations, it turns out a huge part of the anti-choice movement was a scam the entire time. https://t.co/XBwvPKmSqU. Great news!

You can now get a COVID test for FREE at any CityMD in NYC.

Uninsured? No problem.
No appointment? Walk in!

This is how it should be.

If you believe you have COVID symptoms or exposure, get tested.

Essential workers can get tested anytime:
https://t.co/1zurxxwl9y. @caityweaver No worries -  none of this is foundational, and much of it is passed through word of mouth within privileged classes. I<U+0092>m learning along w you!

It<U+0092>s one way the preservation of power works: by keeping certain knowledge behind closed doors. Sharing it helps democratize power. <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD>. @JonahDispatch Hey there! Totally get it if you<U+0092>ve never bothered to read the legislation you<U+0092>re commenting so authoritatively on.

The Green New Deal is a non-binding resolution of values. It does not have a price tag or CBO score and costs us $0 if passed.

Read:
https://t.co/6qsvSW0Ilb. If you<U+0092>d like to learn more about how this austerity class of mostly dudes at vague, esteemed-seeming DC think tanks launder harmful policies to influence lawmakers of both parties, you can read about it here via @thenation: https://t.co/gdO8d0F3UF. This is policy head for @BudgetHawks, btw. They lobby both parties for austerity policies in DC (aka cutting public safety nets when ppl need it most).

I call it out bc it matters when people who seek to influence policy are flippant + misogynistic towards members of Congress. https://t.co/ynyh94ZreT. @anylaurie16 Here is a game I play. Ask the guy <U+0093>really?<U+0094> &amp; for more info on w/e they assume you don<U+0092>t know. Act very interested.

Then keep asking them to explain more &amp; more basic things.See how far they<U+0092>ll go. The game is to find the most absurd basic thing they<U+0091>ll explain before stopping.. If it helps, they could think of it as a subscription service to living in an advanced society.

Just imagine billionaires paying enough so teachers in the US don<U+0092>t have to work multiple jobs and sell their own blood plasma to survive. Call me radical, but it might be worth it. If only there were some public fund billionaires could pay into along with everyone else that helps fund our infrastructure, hospitals, and public systems all at once.

It could even be a modest % of what they earn every year. We could have an agency collect it and everything https://t.co/g0vI45xnYG. I am also encouraged that we<U+0091>re not in this fight alone.

To be on a team w/@CathFlowers, @PramilaJayapal, @FlyingWithSara, @AbdulElSayed, @StephanieKelton, @VarshPrakash &amp; others pushing for 21stc public policy means we are in this together.

Inside pressure. Outside organizing.. I have always believed that real change happens not with a panel or task force, but in everyday people organizing mass movements to demand change.

Yet we should also commit to showing up everywhere- every space where there are decisions &amp;formative conversations - w/ mvmt voices.. After conferring w/ grassroots activists and climate allies, I am accepting @BernieSanders<U+0092> nomination to co-chair the Climate Change Unity Task Force with Sec. @JohnKerry.

Our planet is dangerously imperiled, and wherever there are decisions made, the people must have a voice. https://t.co/xCzEruOwM1. #BreonnaTaylor<U+0092>s family deserves justice.

It is so dehumanizing that Breonna<U+0092>s family &amp; many others must launch public campaigns just to have victim<U+0092>s lives recognized &amp; given the dignity of due process.

She was killed two months ago,&amp; nothing has happened since. #SayHerName <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/wS9NJR8lEC. We are on the brink of an enormous housing crisis, one where renters and small landlords alike are on the brink of getting wiped out.

Who wins? Major corporations willing to gobble them up.

So far, Congress is letting it happen. We *must* protect people before the worst hits. https://t.co/e1vz0mn1gw. Shout out to everyone who just joined us for an impromptu IG Live!

In less than an hour, we raised $12k for @domesticworkers to help support house cleaners, nannies, and care workers across the country during COVID <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F495> https://t.co/B57OQa4Y0r. Even more appalled to see that virtually every signatory of this letter sits on the Financial Services Committee.

Democrat AND Republican members are engaged in this horrendous behavior. It is wrong and erodes the public trust. They should return the cash or rescind the letter.. Are you a constituent of NY-14? Please fill our survey below.

We<U+0092>re organizing community efforts block-by-block for safety + relief during COVID-19.

Your answers will help us map out and organize volunteer efforts, resources, food delivery &amp; more <U+2B07><U+FE0F>
https://t.co/fJcKBN1SD1. UPDATE 3: Okay! After a few visits earlier I am reopening for a few more #AOCHouseCalls<U+0001F3E1>. 

DMs are opening again for 4 minutes, drop me your Dodo code and a note and I may stop by!

(Yes that is a hand drawn campaign shirt &amp; no I haven<U+0092>t sorted out exporting screenshots yet <U+0001F62C>) https://t.co/K7Idxnj09W. Update 2: first ever House call (get it?<U+0001F609>) in the books! 

It was so sweet. Island belonged to a family of three. We exchanged fruit, took pictures, and I signed a bulletin note using my touch screen.

I was floored by how fast they typed and they taught me about the app. <U+0001F970> https://t.co/KJsI6Gjh9p. Update: getting ready to make island visits. Never done this before! Is there etiquette to visiting? Do<U+0092>s &amp; don<U+0092>ts?. Honestly never in my life did I think opening my DMs would grant me faith in humanity but the brief window actually resulted in a lot of these messages being very wholesome <U+0001F62D>

People are asking for surprise visits to their spouse<U+0092>s islands!! This is the love everyone deserves <U+0001F495>. Ok I am going to open my DMs for exactly 4 minutes for Dodo code submission. Why 4? Who knows. Here we go! https://t.co/ZWgivtpILS. Hi there! Very new to this.

I would like to visit random people<U+0092>s islands and leave a doodle or note on their bulletin board.

Can I do that? If so, how?

Should I open my DMs for the first time since the Zuckerberg hearing for the Dodo codes?? https://t.co/pQlm0ES1cM. Other best ways to thank our healthcare and frontline workers is to support PPE production, fully funding our healthcare system, produce mass testing and contact tracing, and forgive student loan debt which is especially crushing in medical fields. Nothing like a corporate PR campaign that burns jet fuel at low altitudes over vulnerable communities dying from a respiratory virus that compounds on our preexisting and disproportionate exposure to air pollution to show healthcare workers we care https://t.co/xyCr3tojgn. The Trump admin is now projecting 3,000 daily deaths by June, and they are STILL pushing to <U+0093>reopen.<U+0094>

We are now careening towards one 9/11-scale death event *per day.* This was all preventable w/ tests, tracing,&amp; policy.

Instead the GOP showered their friends w/ bailout money.. GOP is naming a political operative with no USPS experience as the Postmaster General right before an election where millions of people will try to vote by mail to save their own lives.

They are eroding our democracy and crushing our public institutions before our very eyes. https://t.co/HBOCp1LKTU. @GovHowardDean Thank you, @GovHowardDean! Thankful I don<U+0092>t need to be treated with kid gloves as many right wingers do <U+0001F609><U+0001F9E4>. At some point our country must meaningfully acknowledge that the killings of

Ahmaud Arbery,
Sean Reed,
Sandra Bland,
Tamir Rice,
Trayvon Martin,
Eric Garner,
Rekia Boyd,
Tanisha Anderson,

and countless others are not isolated incidents or <U+0093>bad apples.<U+0094>

It is systemic violence.. Ahmaud Arbery was murdered for being Black.

His White assailants were allowed to roam free *for months* after lynching him. They faced no charges, no arrests. Police had video of Ahmaud<U+0092>s murder the day it happened.

His family deserves justice. Our country deserves answers.. Hint: it starts with a C and ends with -apitalism

(aka this is what happens when Wall Street captures Congress and writes themselves bailout check after bailout check as working people die) https://t.co/S5o9yfD4zc. And I hear @IlhanMN has a bill to do just that!

It<U+0092>s an opportunity for Congress to help working people in an ambitious and meaningful way. Revelatory, I know:
https://t.co/8tiTY4lqzZ. <U+0001F6A8> MAYDAY: Tenants in NYC &amp; across the country are crying out for rent and mortgage relief. Many of the 30+ million laid off workers can<U+0092>t pay record-high rents.

@IlhanMN<U+0092>s bill provides relief to renters &amp; small property owners to prevent economic collapse of working families. https://t.co/1NqhSMvKPg. In an emergency, relief isn<U+0092>t just about getting resources, it<U+0092>s also about of getting them out in time without unnecessary hurdles.

Proud to work with @SenKamalaHarris on clearing the red tape to let FEMA grant assistance to impacted families during pandemics. https://t.co/2heIUoy5bN. Think about how harshly #BlackLivesMatter &amp; #AbolishICE activists were debased, called rioters, &amp; treated as a threat to society.

Now watch &amp; examine how this MAGA-armed rushing of a state legislature is treated.

This is for those who still think racial privilege is a fantasy. https://t.co/nEufuBRFKo. And here are the teaching guides, organizing toolkits, and educational resources to talk this through with your students and kids: https://t.co/L6Wuoj2KQZ. You can now watch the film for FREE distribution and access educational materials and teaching guides for middle school, high school, and higher ed.

Here is the film: https://t.co/1Ql9FpDiaG. Many young people ask me why &amp; how I started running for office from a restaurant, w/o any special connections or big money.

@knockdownmovie tells that story.

Due to COVID, Netflix is releasing the film for free along w/ educational toolkit &amp; curriculum:
https://t.co/THpgkzzqdc. The Bronx Jewish Community Council of Pelham have been operating a food pantry in our community for over 30(!) years.

I am so thrilled we are partnering with them to boost their operations and feed families across our community in this time of intensified need <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD> https://t.co/lbOloG8HdM. When I warned everyone in *February* that Pence doesn<U+0092>t believe in science and shouldn<U+0092>t be in charge of COVID response, I meant it.

But I admit I did not have <U+0093>VP visits COVID patients without wearing a mask<U+0094> on my bingo board. https://t.co/LmMM3n0Eng. These young leaders at MS 228 in the Bronx are taking community leadership into their own hands by raising + delivering meals to seniors to protect them from exposure.

They are modeling powerful, intergenerational servant leadership.

It<U+0092>s an honor to be part of their journey <U+0001F49C> https://t.co/h49AlLeNHQ. If you<U+0092>re a news outlet who spent time &amp;effort covering protesters demanding we risk workers<U+0092> lives for a root touch-up, consider spending time on the #CantPayMay strikes across the country &amp;ask what Congress is doing to protect ppl from foreclosures + evictions.

Just a thought! https://t.co/kwr3q3WziS. Now is the time to stand up for mom + pops &amp; protect them from getting wiped out by Wall Street.

That means checking mega corps from gobbling up small biz during a global crisis. @ewarren &amp; I have the bill.

A few bankers may cry about it, but something tells me they<U+0092>ll live <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> https://t.co/SQ7xeMEwYW. Congress gave a $4 TRILLION check to Wall Street while sending mom+pops on a wild goose chase for PPP.

That is major, oligarchic, economy-shaping power Congress just gave the wealthy.

The LEAST we should do is halt big mergers during COVID to slow the consolidation of sectors. https://t.co/WjRXlrs5wR. When it comes to guaranteeing healthcare, providing relief on rents and mortgages, and paying workers dignified wages: 

<U+0093>We don<U+0092>t need patronizing, we need [Congress to] pass a damn bill!<U+0094> - @RevDrBarber https://t.co/J0GGu9fIeA. Over 20 million people have lost their jobs since COVID-19 hit the US.

Not one deserves to be frightened about eviction or foreclosure during a pandemic.

Join us in 10 mins w/ @housing4allNY talking abt how to organize for housing justice during COVID-19.https://t.co/nCGzf8hHnF. As I have said: unity isn<U+0092>t a feeling, it<U+0092>s a process.

Undemocratic, unilateral decisions that disenfranchise millions of progressive voters &amp;volunteers is extremely destructive to the process of unifying the party for Nov.

Dems must take this seriously. This is the wrong call.. Primary results matters beyond who wins 1st place. Sen. Sanders explicitly stated that he intended on continuing to collect delegates in order to advance wage, healthcare, climate &amp; other priorities into the platform at the convention.

The @DNC should respond to this decision.. Read this statement.

No matter who you support, it is extremely dangerous that New York is establishing a precedent of cancelling elections citing COVID. Ballots were certified &amp; neither candidate asked for this.

The decision should be overturned immediately. #LetUsVote https://t.co/ehgJlmXkMj. The best way to thank our essential workers is to guarantee them:

<U+2705> living wages
<U+2705> paid sick leave
<U+2705> hazard pay
<U+2705> labor protections
<U+2705> healthcare, childcare, &amp; more

Join @ewarren and I on IG Live in 10 mins to rally for an Essential Workers Bill of Rights! <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD> https://t.co/3ZZciehNdI. Again: NY is still holding primary elections on June 23rd. This decision does not change the fact that people will still be going outside to vote.

If NY doesn<U+0092>t want to risk possibly millions of ppl voting in-person, we need to mail everyone a ballot. Not an application for one.. It is completely wrong for the BOE to cancel New York<U+0092>s Presidential Primary.

This decision is not informed by public health: the state is still holding elections for every other seat that day, &amp; so far the only way your ballot will 100% be counted in NY is to vote in person! https://t.co/l8iT7mxm9c. I say this bc I don<U+0092>t want GOP lawmakers to lie to the public &amp; pretend they didn<U+0092>t see a payment crisis coming. They know &amp; are choosing not to stop it.

Just like they pretended to act surprised when PPP went to the rich instead of mom &amp; pops, when they WROTE the bill that way.. I want everyone to know that the White House, Mnuchin, McConnell &amp; Congress *know* that there is a housing crisis looming due to inaction on rent + mortgage relief.

If we don<U+0092>t act ASAP, millions could face foreclosure &amp; eviction.

Dems have plans to stop it. It<U+0092>s being blocked. https://t.co/93R7o1wHhh. Our community is so thankful to each of you volunteering a check-in shift from home &amp;contributing to our on-the-ground relief effort.

So far #TeamAOC has called over 56,000 constituents + raised over $300,000 for local food pantries &amp; orgs.

Join us here: https://t.co/b2B8vjNZ9l https://t.co/GgQa1d4DoT. @krossny1 @jduffyrice Thanks! I wish I could help young women navigate these things more specifically because it took me a long time and a lot of effort to figure out when I was just starting out. I<U+0092>m still learning. Doing your own gel mani at home w/ a peel off base coat is a life (and nail) saver!. Congress just voted for the first time in a MONTH on a bill that doesn<U+0092>t address the core issues facing working families. Then they adjourned again until further notice.

<U+0093>Someday<U+0094> and <U+0093>next time<U+0094> doesn<U+0092>t cut it.

Struggling families need a timeline.
https://t.co/nC1eegtlbY. @SarahHuckabee Look who<U+0092>s talking about showing up for work! The woman didn<U+0092>t hold a press conference for months while holding a job as press sec.

If you<U+0092>re so supportive of this admin<U+0092>s plan, why don<U+0092>t you go out and try delivering groceries for a living w/o health insurance or mass testing?. And by the way, setting up vulnerable workers to grind 70 hours a week to barely survive and STILL not have health insurance is unsafe too.. Trump has NO PLAN to get people safely back to work. 

GOP Govs like Kemp are sending vulnerable workers to die w/ false claims of safety.

Trump also pushed an unproven, dangerous treatment as a <U+0093>cure<U+0094> &amp; firing experts who want to vet claims.

Last thing you care abt is safety. https://t.co/3yEgTp3dqf. @ewarren My heart breaks for your family. I am so very sorry for your loss, and our prayers are with your family.. .@fatjoe really put the heat on and pressed me for my Top Five after asking me about federal COVID response <U+0001F62D>

Thank you Joe - I<U+0092>m thankful we had the opportunity to connect and talk about how coronavirus is impacting our communities, and have some lighter moments thrown in too. https://t.co/PGdbRO07pJ. GOP is seriously arguing that it<U+0092>s worth sacrificing the lives of hourly workers so they can get a spray tan again.

If they really wanted to reopen the economy, they<U+0091>d fund mass testing, contact tracing,&amp; healthcare for people.

Instead they<U+0092>re fighting against hospital funding.. My mom learned English at 23 and sent 2 kids to college scrubbing toilets after my dad died. She raised the youngest woman elected to Congress.

You should take your classist garbage &amp; realize that the workers YOU rely on to eat are not <U+0091>disappointments<U+0092> or unworthy human beings. https://t.co/H2krsGVFtP. Also can we talk about how racist &amp; classist the presumption is that when people say they are from the Bronx, folks like Tucker equate that with assuming all the worst things abt our upbringing?

Our lives don<U+0092>t have to match some chicken heir<U+0092>s idea of struggle to be validated.. I<U+0092>ve lost track -

Am I <U+0093>just a bartender<U+0094> who should go back to making drinks without health insurance, or am I a secretly deceitful child of privilege because I<U+0092>m an heiress of the Swanson frozen food empire OH WAIT sorry that<U+0092>s Tucker Carlson. https://t.co/CNw32VwTbh. @Dburns4221 When the coal industry started a long-term decline, instead of moving swiftly to support workers, DC got into a lobbyist-friendly vicious cycle of bailouts that helped co<U+0092>s more than it helped workers.

This time we need to invest in creating opportunities &amp; financial security.. @Dburns4221 What we need to do is bring workers like you to the table in our transition to renewable infrastructure, &amp; guaranteeing pensions for fossil fuel workers.

If you see what is happening to coal workers, the mines get $ and workers are hung to dry. We can<U+0092>t allow for that to happen.. This snapshot is being acknowledged as a turning point in the climate movement.

Fossil fuels are in long-term structural decline. This along w/ low interest rates means it<U+0091>s the right time to create millions of jobs transitioning to renewable and clean energy. A key opportunity. https://t.co/UqT8DI5u2I. Now is the time to create millions of good jobs building out the infrastructure and clean energy necessary to save our planet for future generations.

For our economy, our planet, and our future, we need a #GreenNewDeal.. It is simply outrageous that Congress is considering voting on a small, patchwork bill after being out of session for a MONTH and recessing again without knowing when we will next convene.

Thousands of people are DYING. PPP will quickly run out again. We need a bigger bill.. Rent doesn<U+0092>t wait on Congress.

I understand the idea of an <U+0093>interim<U+0094> patch bill, but if Congress doesn<U+0092>t know when it will next convene, we need to vote on a bigger fix now.

We need WAY more for PPP, $2000 monthly cash payments (plus $1k for each child), &amp; cover health bills.. @BenSpielberg @HollyBlomberg Didn<U+0092>t vote for it, and for everyone upset about the non-recorded vote - in the House rules, you need about *44* members (1/5 of quorum) to rise to successfully request a recorded vote. One person standing up doesn<U+0092>t make it happen - Massie tried.. @PatrickJags Your wife can now apply for unemployment under the new stimulus package rules. She may also likely be eligible for PPP when it gets funded again (likely this week).. There are a LOT of fake memes going around about the $1200 stimulus checks. Just got asked about it in the elevator.

To clarify:

- You do NOT have to pay back your stimulus check next year.

- Your stimulus check is NOT taxable.

The stimulus is yours to keep. No takebacks <U+263A><U+FE0F>. <U+0093>McKinsey has faced mounting scrutiny over the past two years... The consultancy returned millions after South African authorities implicated it in a profiteering scheme... McKinsey<U+0092>s bankruptcy practice is the subject of a federal criminal investigation.<U+0094> https://t.co/FvIf4DS6oF. Remember when the government retained McKinsey to draft their immigration logistics &amp; McKinsey<U+0092>s proposed <U+0093>solutions<U+0094> were so brutal that it even shocked ICE officials?

Yeah. Foxes planning the henhouse reopening is not a good idea.

Austerity in a pandemic isn<U+0092>t a good idea. https://t.co/OLyKKJHVJt. Take it from NY14, the most COVID-impacted community in America:

There is a clear reason our communities are hit hardest by COVID: the vast, systemic inequalities that were growing pre-COVID are now determining who lives or dies in this pandemic.

It<U+0092>s time for Medicare for All. https://t.co/P5imObmNp1. 100s of meals at our Bronx office packed up and ready to go w/ #TeamAOC volunteers.

This effort is 100% from the people, using small-dollar donations organized via our email list <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD>

Thank you to everyone offering time + resources. Lots of families eating tonight bc of you. https://t.co/xcvITdcKPV. This week alone, New York has lost more people than we did on 9/11.

I<U+0092>ve been on the phone all week with sobbing nurses, health aides, warehouse &amp; frontline workers.

COVID is a traumatic event. We must make serious investments for the mental healthcare of our frontline workers. https://t.co/xuY2xgWiTb. So far we have raised more than $100,000 directly to food pantries and relief efforts.

We are getting close to $200k! Can you help us get there and feed more families? https://t.co/Htd6WaW1tf. For the last few weeks we<U+0091>ve dedicated 100% of usual campaign fundraising to NY14 food pantries &amp; orgs.

#TeamAOC vols have been doing call shifts to ID the needy &amp; deliver food.

Big thanks to Hungry Monk Rescue for helping us coordinate food pantry delivery in LeFrak City yday! https://t.co/5bmFvRIw1x. The tea <U+0001F375>: Electoralism has limits. Elected officials often don<U+0092>t lead our most impactful societal changes, they follow them.

The heroes who lead true change are the activists, artists, organizers &amp; others who educate + push society forward.

Takes both.
https://t.co/7lXba5AryT. - Enacting the public charge rule (punishes immigrants for seeking medical attn, food assistance) despite knowing that COVID was on a trajectory to become a widespread public health crisis
- Allowing ICE to continue moving children into NYC &amp; facilities with confirmed COVID cases. How is Trump<U+0092>s response xenophobic?
- Targets Asian community in his rhetoric &amp; TV ads, incl ads depicting Asian Americans as Chinese officials
- Late, little, or no translation of public health mandates into multiple languages
- Booting ITIN immigrant taxpayers from CARES relief. Corona, Queens is the most heavily COVID-impacted zip code in America. I can tell you 1st hand that many ppl are too scared to go to the hospital &amp; continue to work bc of Trump<U+0092>s xenophobic COVID response.

In that uncertainty, street vendors are stepping up and saving lives <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/nYkjhwXcPI. Thank you for your courage, vulnerability, and bravery in sharing your family<U+0092>s immigration story, @JackieCoxNYC <U+2665><U+FE0F>

I<U+0092>m honored you chose to share it with me. You<U+0092>re doing NYC proud! https://t.co/NQGDEwm7yA. <U+0094>Let<U+0092>s be clear who we<U+0092>re talking about: a hedge fund that runs a bunch of billionaire family offices? Who cares?

They won<U+0092>t summer in the Hamptons? Who cares? On Main Street today, people are getting wiped out. Hedge funds are not.<U+0094>

https://t.co/5LUm5n8Vde. 100s of people are dying in their homes in NYC each day &amp; haven<U+0092>t been included in COVID counts.

That<U+0092>s starting to change, but many death tolls we<U+0091>ve seen are *confirmed cases,* aka lab-tested.

It<U+0092>s another inequality issue.Other cities shld note &amp;track COVID-likely cases too. https://t.co/MA58GDgmlz. This is a bad idea. A really bad one, on multiple levels - for starters, it threatens the integrity of Dem voter data &amp; puts Nov prospects in hands of a shady firm w/ a failed track record.

Plenty of orgs bid for contracts. I hope there is enough good sense to reject this one. https://t.co/8kRIog03YM.

Yes, you read that right. It<U+0092>s completely irresponsible.

If anything, we should err on the side of testing <U+0093>too much<U+0094> - we<U+0092>re *nowhere* near that.

We welcome their contempt.<U+270C><U+0001F3FD> https://t.co/kdIQGdhd1L. Sometimes it still stops me in my tracks that because I believe insulin should be free, workers shld be paid justly, we shld house the homeless and not cage families, &amp; that all people should be free to pursue education as they wish,for THAT we are treated as radical &amp; dangerous.. East Elmhurst is a historically Black community in the shadow of LGA<U+0092>s fumes.

This is why environmental justice is a core principle of the Green New Deal.

We must acknowledge the impact of racial disparity in power + policy if we are going to fix this.

The Bronx already had some of the highest asthma rates in the US. Then COVID hit. https://t.co/EWoXdLtu8H. Thank you Bernie - for doing your best to fight for all of us, from the beginning, for your entire life.

Thank you for fighting hard, lonely fights in true devotion to a people<U+0092>s movement in the United States.

Thank you for your leadership, mentorship, and example. We love you. https://t.co/CqErUDlsvX https://t.co/33x7hm5ErH. If you don<U+0092>t believe undocumented workers should have access to relief during #COVID19, does that mean you<U+0092>re willing return the billions they pay in taxes each year? Will you defund your schools?

Or, in this moment, will we recognize that we should just take care of each other?. Are you an NY small business with questions about accessing SBA Disaster Loans &amp; the Payroll Protection Program?

I<U+0092>m about to walk everyone through applying LIVE on Zoom starting in 5 minutes, &amp; again at 7pm (answering your Live Q&amp;A for both sessions):
https://t.co/DK18eygLOy. Last week I walked you through applying for unemployment.

Tomorrow I<U+0092>m walking NY14 small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program &amp; Disaster Loans + Grants.

Keep workers on payroll &amp; loans will be 100% forgiven - sole proprietors, too.

RSVP: https://t.co/DK18eygLOy. I incl that last detail to illustrate that these are also HISTORICALLY Black communities, which means they have been impacted by racist policies like redlining for generations.

This pandemic is happening in CONTEXT. &amp; a lot of folks who deny racism have no idea what it really is. To all the people that said <U+0093>there<U+0092>s no evidence racial disparities in COVID impact exist.<U+0094> <U+2B07><U+FE0F><U+2B07><U+FE0F><U+2B07><U+FE0F>

I represent the most impacted neighborhoods in the country: Corona &amp; East Elmhurst.

These are overwhelmingly Black &amp; Latino neighborhoods. Louis Armstrong<U+0092>s house is here. https://t.co/NPAXdR1GHS. I deal w/ a lot of violent threats, vitriol, etc.

But I never get more hate aimed at me than when I address racial inequities.

If some people think racial disparities are as much a myth as other issues I discuss, then why do they get so much more violent &amp; angry on this topic?. Didn<U+0092>t you just put a doctor on your show who faked their employment at Lenox Hill hospital and touted a COVID <U+0093>treatment<U+0094> that you tweeted &amp; Twitter had to remove because a man may have died trying self-administer it?

I<U+0092>m sorry, why are you on TV again? https://t.co/Lfc6RvtBDS. The $500 billion<U+27A1><U+FE0F>$4 trillion slush fund for Wall Street was almost immediately available, very liquid, and practically comes with concierge service from Treasury.

The $350b for small biz is slower, w/ more strings, &amp; less liquid.

Ease of capital is a baked-in inequality, too. https://t.co/mLyHNLAX5Y. By almost every measure, our Queens community is the hardest hit in the country by COVID.

I am heartbroken to share that Priscilla Carrow, a giant &amp; compassionate leader who served as an Elmhurst hospital worker, Community Board 4 member, CWA local 1180 member, has passed. https://t.co/KDjiIfQjYM. COVID deaths are disproportionately spiking in Black + Brown communities.

Why? Because the chronic toll of redlining, environmental racism, wealth gap, etc. ARE underlying health conditions.

Inequality is a comorbidity. COVID relief should be drafted with a lens of reparations.. Amazon<U+0092>s attempt to smear Chris Smalls, one of their own warehouse workers, as <U+0093>not smart or articulate<U+0094> is a racist &amp; classist PR campaign.

If execs are as concerned abt worker health &amp; safety as they claim, then they should provide the full paid sick leave ALL workers deserve. https://t.co/pAubxenDwr. 10 million people *that we know of* are newly unemployed in the US.

This is an unprecedented crisis.

The Federal gov has the power to guarantee healthcare, housing, &amp; basic income. 

Yet conservative officials are resisting doing the bare minimum to save lives. It<U+0092>s a betrayal. https://t.co/YshBMvjrTR. MFW I<U+0092>ve done what feels like 800 livestreams, interviews, zoom calls, FB lives and IG stories this week and someone asks me to make a TikTok https://t.co/YxZYCf9r4o. Are you a New Yorker that<U+0092>s never applied for unemployment before, or needs help accessing the upcoming $1200 cash payment?

I got you!

TONIGHT @ 7pm I am personally walking you through the process of applying for UI and answering your questions.

RSVP: https://t.co/v6XWwFMenG https://t.co/Cr4ps8CA1W. The real April Fool<U+0092>s joke is on everyone expecting the millions of people who just lost their incomes to pay full rent, mortgages,&amp; major bills *TODAY* w/ few actual policies in place to help them do so. 

<U+0093>Wait and see<U+0094> is not a plan. We need payment &amp; housing relief policies.. This video is powerful not just bc of Samelys, but bc it actively educates people on structural inequity + history of the South Bronx.

It<U+0092>s a campaign discussing redlining, NYC shelter system, the Young Lords, housing+healthcare guarantees.

@SamelysLopez is the real deal. <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F49C> https://t.co/wvovMTPYJg. One thing I hope quarantine can teach is that childcare/caregiving is LABOR.

People are ordinarily paid (not enough) to do it, but those who aren<U+0092>t being paid are still doing a full job.

&amp; right now parents+caregivers WFH are doing 2+ jobs simultaneously.https://t.co/Ch0qBixFzm. @aidachavez It was admittedly quite jarring to be watching that wild trip of a series and then all of a sudden see my colleagues have cameos in it <U+0001F602>. When I advocate for basic human rights, people will dismiss the substance of what I say due to my <U+0093>tone.<U+0094>

But if you<U+0092>re Trump, some of those same folks will cite <U+0093>tone<U+0094> to minimize his reckless flu comparisons, science denial, and lagging response costing 1000s of lives.

Wild. https://t.co/I3whxdg5JQ. Every year we sacrifice human lives for the sake of our for-profit healthcare system, &amp; next year is poised to get worse.

What happens when your insurance becomes unaffordable, but you <U+0093>make too much<U+0094> for Medicaid? Millions go uninsured &amp; underinsured.

We need #MedicareforAll. https://t.co/xiBuQWgBx9. @J_ManPrime21 Can<U+0092>t control what people say about me, only what I do. Manufactured cynicism is a real thing.

I<U+0092>m blessed to be held accountable and made better by activists + movements. If you point to actions I can adopt to be better I<U+0092>m grateful, but I can<U+0092>t do anything about gossip. Sry!. First Instacart, then Amazon, now Whole Foods: workers are withholding their labor&amp; demanding dignity.

When people work an hourly job, it<U+0092>s suggested in many ways that you<U+0091>re unimportant or expendable.

Except you aren<U+0092>t. Everyone deserves safe work, paid leave, &amp; a living wage. https://t.co/JCC7A6RiUe. One of the best ways to thank essential workers is to support the fight to improve their lives.

Instacart &amp; Amazon workers are on strike for:
- Safer working conditions
- Paid leave 4all
- Hazard pay

You can help. Skip your order today &amp;offer to help those who rely on delivery. https://t.co/7Z3wTNB0fF. Heartbroken to share that #LorenaBorjas, a prolific trans organizer &amp; Queens activist, passed away from COVID-19.

Lorena championed mutual aid in the LGBT+ community, and her Community Fund was saving lives of queer people &amp; immigrants impacted by COVID:
https://t.co/q1X2Fga4WU https://t.co/VbGiYYqPTl. If you don<U+0092>t hire a domestic worker or would like to help them in other ways, you can support the @domesticworkers #CoronaVirusCareFund here:

https://t.co/wiR0tWiu6Z. Yes: if you hire a domestic worker and have the means, PLEASE continue to pay them through this crisis.

So many families rely on domestic work to survive. My mom cleaned houses to put me through college as my dad went through cancer treatment.

Your $ keeps a family fed &amp;housed. https://t.co/3liiWa41rV. Starting in 5 MINS:

Who<U+0092>s getting a $1200 check?

What do UI benefits look like if you were just laid off?

How can you help others in need?

Hop on with @mPinoe &amp; I for a Coronavirus package Instagram Q&amp;A!

Forward your Qs to Megan using the hashtag #PinoeAskAOC
(IG: mrapinoe) https://t.co/M4BRv4m8lo. COVID outbreaks are happening in Amazon warehouses in NYC &amp; across the country.

It<U+0092>s more important than ever to fight for essential workers<U+0092> rights incl. hazard pay, paid leave, &amp; COVID-safe workplace conditions.

That means delivery drivers, too. https://t.co/LucZErQ7Lg. And just like that, the Congressional oversight provisions for the 1/2 TRILLION dollar Wall St slush fund (which were *already* too weak) are tossed away the day the bill is signed.

This is a frightening amount of public money to have given a corrupt admin w/ 0 accountability. https://t.co/yhL62fj58R. The cruise industry registers as foreign companies to avoid paying US taxes. Now they want US bailout money.

Now the same Republicans who say immigrants who pay US taxes shouldn<U+0092>t get help are bending over backwards to give <U+0001F911> to foreign companies who DON<U+0092>T pay taxes.

Insane. https://t.co/inpD0wYWNU. Republicans put more strings and means-testing on single parents and struggling mom + pops than they do on multibillion dollar corporations that don<U+0092>t pay taxes.. Items that *are* in the bill:
- $200b for hospitals
- $150b for state + local govs
- 4 mos expanded unemployment insurance, incl gig workers &amp; others
- $377b for small biz loans w/ forgiveness eligibility
- $30b in emergency education funding. What Trump + Senate GOP have done is hold hospitals, working people, and the vulnerable hostage so they could get in $500 billion (that will be leveraged into $4T) in corporate welfare.

Without the Wall St giveaway, GOP refuses to fund hospitals &amp; unemployment. It<U+0092>s inhumane.. To clarify, $1200 checks are ONLY going to some w/social sec numbers, NOT immigrants w/ tax IDs (ITINs).

Thanks to GOP, these checks will be cut off the backs of *taxpaying immigrants,* who get nothing. Many are essential workers who pay more taxes than Amazon.

Wall St gets $4T. I just don<U+0092>t understand how it<U+0092>s reasonable to expect what could be millions of people and small businesses, who suddenly had their incomes cut off, to pay rent, mortgages, &amp; major bills on Apr 1st without any payment moratoriums or immediate relief.. Just a reminder that there is absolutely no good reason why Senate Republicans are tying a historic corporate giveaway to getting relief money in the hands of families.

They could just authorize sending checks to families today, right now, &amp; deal with the rest. But they refuse.. For days, major CEOs &amp; certain powerful people have been admitting, in clear terms, that they are willing to sacrifice people<U+0092>s lives for their profits, but are NOT willing to sacrifice their profit for people<U+0092>s lives.

Remember this lesson, bc it informs a LOT of US policy. https://t.co/Dk0jNshuoE. The Senate might ADJOURN FOR A MONTH after this bill?

This is completely dangerous and unacceptable. We HAVE to be able to respond to people<U+0092>s needs.

People don<U+0092>t have this time. Even IF the Senate can even return on the 20th (big IF) that may not be enough time to solve May. https://t.co/O5XnubG0l1. Dozens of people, both workers&amp; the incarcerated, have tested positive for COVID-19 on Rikers.

Many are forcibly cramped into close quarters. They do not have reliable access to soap or sanitizer. This is a humanitarian crisis.

Decarceral action must become an urgent priority. https://t.co/IDbNN3etew. The developments of this Senate relief bill are concerning.

We are hearing lots of vague statements, but not a single member of Congress has seen actual bill text.

It seems to give a *HALF TRILLION DOLLARS* away to big corporations, w/ few worker protections.

Half a trillion.. All Federal student loans can now be suspended for 2 months.

That bill can for sure be taken care of, but it is NOT automatic. You need to call your servicer to get it done:

https://t.co/dJVC7bMFbq. The 1st of the month is coming up.

One thing that you can do right now if you<U+0092>ve been financially impacted is call ALL your bill providers &amp; ask to defer your April payment.

Phone bill, mortgage, credit cards, student loans - many are doing so, but you *must* contact them.. On Saturday, our campaign began mobilizing volunteers for COVID community check-in calls.

Vols are connected via Zoom party &amp; trained to help our NY-14 neighbors.

We were able to call 2,700 neighbors in one day!

Let<U+0092>s keep it up. Try a shift this week:
https://t.co/b2B8vjNZ9l. Yes. Many who<U+0092>ve never had to deal with the consequences of such rhetoric think objecting to the President<U+0092>s racism is about <U+0093>political correctness.<U+0094>

Really, it<U+0092>s about protecting the millions of people who<U+0092>ve become more vulnerable to hate crimes as a result of such language. https://t.co/WOgrUDrrta. Collins voted for the GOP tax scam.
She voted to appoint Kavanaugh.
She<U+0092>s defending an utterly corrupt bill to shower public money on friends and donors.

Susan Collins is not a moderate. She just plays one on TV.. .@SenatorCollins can keep her crocodile tears.

She voted &amp; fought HARD to strip pandemic prep funding. She helped drive the lack of preparation that we had leading up to this.

What<U+0092>s actually disgraceful is her <U+0093>I<U+0092>m a Moderate Lady<U+0094> dance to cover up brutal policies and votes. https://t.co/sY2Iv4y3fT. In NY &amp; NJ *alone* over 2,500 airport workers are being laid off.

Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell &amp; the GOP are pushing a crony capitalist slush fund bill for friends &amp; donors, and slapped the word <U+0093>Coronavirus<U+0094> on it.

Hell no. We must put people FIRST: UBI, paid leave, health $,etc https://t.co/SrEzsRg64l. Eviction, foreclosure, &amp; shut-off suspensions are good but they are nowhere near enough.

People don<U+0092>t want to be in the position where the moment the orders are lifted there will be a marshal at their door. They still feel like rent is due unless a payment moratorium is called.. Govs: Extended stay-at-home orders cannot be successful without issuing mortgage, rent, + debt moratoriums to go with them.

Many people are going out bc they are panicked about paying bills due next wk on the 1st.

Payment suspensions keep ppl indoors. Bills bring them outside.. <U+0093>GOP *refusing to increase $ for hospitals,* but HAVE increased corporate bailout $.<U+0094>

The Senate GOP plan is corrupt.  Their greed &amp; incompetence is going to get people killed. Others will be displaced, or unable to eat.

They<U+0091>re holding our country hostage for a Wall St payday. https://t.co/lySpwfDNck. Two major economic actions we should take to stabilize working families:

1. Get checks into everyone<U+0092>s hands NOW. We can tax it back next year from the privileged who don<U+0092>t need it.

2. Stop the money OUT. Suspend all major bill payments including mortgages, rent, loans, etc. https://t.co/lmSfcS72N9. Food workers.
Grocery clerks.
Cashiers.
Delivery drivers.
Warehouse stockers.

They were never <U+0093>unskilled workers.<U+0094>
They were always essential.

And it<U+0092>s WAY past time they got the respect they deserve w/ a living wage, paid sick leave, guaranteed healthcare, hazard pay, &amp; more.. Thank you for speaking up and leading, Fran Marion.

You deserve paid sick leave, and any multi-billion dollar corporation telling you they <U+0093>can<U+0092>t afford it<U+0094> is wrong. https://t.co/g22IsVgrRX. The major need that hospitals across the country are echoing: PPE supplies and equipment.

COVID is set to spike. There aren<U+0092>t enough masks, gloves, ventilators, beds, etc to treat people.

Trump needed to order mass production over a week ago to save lives.

He didn<U+0092>t. https://t.co/9ZXJPpjYxs. @JoaquinCastrotx That<U+0092>s why we need to suspend mortgage, rent, &amp; loan payments! It<U+0092>s important people get money in, but we also need to stop the money out.. Let<U+0092>s take this lesson and move it forward to push for a better world.

We CAN guarantee healthcare.
We CAN treat housing as a right.
We CAN pursue decarceral policy.
We CAN prioritize humanitarian foreign policy.
We can. We can. We can.. One enormous, major lesson that I hope people realize in this moment:

Resistance to revolutionary policy was never really about a lack of money, or capacity, or logistics.

It was always about power and a lack of political will.. If price gouging COVID treatment shld be criminal, shouldn<U+0092>t it be for insulin too?

If mayors can suspend arrests on low-priority, low-level offenses, why didn<U+0092>t they before?

If mass evictions are a crisis now, why wasn<U+0092>t the highest homelessness % since the Depression one too?. It<U+0092>s important we realize how this virus hasn<U+0092>t just created new problems; but poured gasoline on the crises we<U+0092>ve long had.

It<U+0092>s okay if you didn<U+0092>t see the extreme urgency of our healthcare, housing, wage, carceral, FPol,etc crises before. But I hope you don<U+0092>t unsee them later.. We need to cover 100% of the costs of uninsured &amp; underinsured people right now.

Not just Coronavirus bills, either - getting sick can set off a domino effect of complications.

It<U+0092>s barbaric to bankrupt people over healthcare &amp; medicine they need to live.

Always has been. #M4A https://t.co/WsD0vZyO8d. Members of Congress should not be allowed to own individual stock.

We are here to serve the public, not to profiteer. It<U+0092>s shocking that it<U+0092>s even been allowed up to this point.. It is stomach-churning that the first thoughts these Senators had to a dire &amp; classified #COVID briefing was how to profit off this crisis.

They didn<U+0092>t mobilize to help families, or prep response. They dumped stock.

Sen. Loeffler needs to resign, too. https://t.co/3lx1Bjt4be. As Intel chairman, @SenatorBurr got private briefings about Coronavirus weeks ago.

Burr knew how bad it would be. He told the truth to his wealthy donors, while assuring the public that we were fine.

THEN he sold off $1.6 million in stock before the fall.

He needs to resign. https://t.co/IAITMbJ3R5. 2/3 of NYC residents are renters.

Now that New York State has issued a MORTGAGE moratorium, we must also enact a RENT moratorium to prevent mass displacement.

Relief and protection from displacement shouldn<U+0092>t just be for homeowners and the wealthy.

It should be for everyone.. If your member is in touch w/ home, they are likely doing the same.

Having a Dem rep isn<U+0092>t a <U+0093>set it and forget it<U+0094> thing. Don<U+0092>t just say <U+0093>oh, they<U+0092>ll do the right thing.<U+0094>

We NEED you to help us understand what you care about. 2 districts could have diff top 3 priorities. CALL.. Please know that these calls matter a LOT. I constantly monitor call topics **from constituents** so I can best prioritize what I<U+0092>m working on for NY-14 in the flurry of legislation.

If I have two good priorities and need to triage them,I ask what constituents are calling about.. <U+0001F6A8> If you live in New York &amp; have an employer, you are now eligible for paid sick leave.

If you are a gig/contract worker: PLEASE CALL YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS.

Ask them what they<U+0092>re supporting to take care of you. If they don<U+0092>t hear it, they may not know it<U+0092>s a district concern. https://t.co/kZ8Dopl2v9. Here<U+0092>s an illustrated summary of our #WeGotOurBlock mutual aid training made by supporter Becca!

If you<U+0092>d like to listen to the audio of the call &amp; get our resource kit, you can still RSVP &amp; it<U+0092>ll be emailed to you.

MAJOR thank you to @prisonculture for the incredible overview. https://t.co/FZEh1kgnge. Our #MutualAid training is kicking off NOW and we<U+0092>ll be using the hashtag #WeGotOurBlock to live tweet!

There IS a call cap and we are RSVP<U+0092>d to be overbooked, so hop on ASAP to get on the call.

If you can<U+0092>t make it, we<U+0092>ll be sending you a recording along with our resource kit. https://t.co/05x4HNdARV. <U+0001F6A8>New York State is now suspending all STATE debt collection.<U+0001F6A8>

Specifically, that means if you owe **New York State** any debt payments (student, medical, etc) you will not have to pay for at least the next 30 days.

This is a great move. The federal gov should follow suit. https://t.co/3kdjG1uen4. In the short term, we need emergency measures to get people through.

Long term we shld consider using current interest rates&amp;make sweeping investments that create millions of jobs decarbonizing our economy, from infra to edu.

The GND was written as a stimulus for people+planet. https://t.co/Bsd2J8BZAm. One bright spot: despite powerful attempts in DC to protect an anti-LGBT+, anti-choice Dem in a safe blue seat, powerful progressive @Marie4Congress won the #IL03 primary!

Congratulations, Marie. You &amp; every organizer worked so hard to make this happen.

Thank you #IL03 voters! https://t.co/xbwSiFAim1. (And because he qualifies for a pension, he would still receive a check long after leaving the Senate.)

So maybe, just once, we can fight so every American can have the dignity of housing, food, &amp; education without feeling like we<U+0092>re one illness away from life falling apart.. We need to bailout tipped, freelance, hourly/shift &amp; gig workers.

That means:
<U+2705> UBI / cash assistance
<U+2705> Rent, Mortgage, &amp; Debt payment suspensions
<U+2705> Paid leave for EVERY worker
<U+2705> Immediate unemployment insurance
<U+2705> Guaranteed healthcare

We can<U+0092>t leave anyone behind. https://t.co/CZDq92otpU. Did you know you can organize your building, block or neighborhood for #COVID to help others &amp; keep people safe?

It<U+0092>s called Mutual Aid.

Join me + legendary organizer Mariame Kaba TOMORROW as we walk through the steps of supporting others safely.

RSVP: https://t.co/3IOWKkvaox. 96% of airline profits over the last decade went to buying up their own stocks to juice the price - not raising wages or other investments.

If there is so much as a DIME of corporate bailout money in the next relief package, it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks.. @scottsantens There is a *huge* difference between UBI proposals that kick millions of people off Medicaid, SNAP, etc (aka people ending with net less $) w/o consent and a UBI proposal that provides people with net more in their lives.

Conflating the two is dangerous and creates resistance.. Expanding small biz loans is an acceptable consideration- but we must avoid allowing this crisis to put millions of people in insurmountable debt.

Checks to people are good and I applaud the proposal, but it<U+0092>s not enough. But we need payment suspensions to get people through.. Good. Now we must suspend student loan payments.

Suspending interest does nothing if people still have to pay out the same amount in principal.

We need to suspend student loan *payments* for 3-6 months to give people wiggle room to afford food &amp; necessities. https://t.co/wKblUHVwh2. This is unacceptable.

Trump is using this public health crisis as an opportunity to push tax cuts and corporate bailouts.

This is an emergency. We need to help vulnerable people &amp; small biz now w/ paid leave, extended unemployment, UBI, Medicaid expansion,&amp;mortgage suspensions. https://t.co/kOAK3sTFdK. Michael Tubbs is the mayor of Stockton, CA who started a UBI pilot in his city long before the idea went mainstream.

They have been sending $500 debit cards to people in Stockton making &lt;$46k.

It<U+0092>s a limited, but real-life implementation and they have learned a lot. Google him! https://t.co/pddg6jAUCV. What we should seriously start to consider now for the medium &amp; long term (bc it will take time) is New Deal-style policy.

We need a mix of policies to help put a lot of people to work. Climate transition, edu expansion w/ apprenticeships &amp; colleges, M4A.

These are jobs bills.. BE CAREFUL with UBI proposals you see popping up.

They are not all created equal, &amp; they can have large macroeconomic, inflationary &amp; systemic effects.

Proposals should be weighed in a larger policy mix incl paymnt suspensions, jobs guarantee, unemp. expansion, paid leave,etc.. A Federal Jobs Guarantee is a complementary program that addresses some people<U+0092>s immediate problem (lack of work) without pumping cash w/o productivity into the economy.

Jobs Guarantee does not solve the issue for everyone but it should also be considered in the policy mix.. Yes. Full transparency: My issues w/ non-emergency UBI have to do w/ domino effects that have not been sufficiently addressed: triggering mass disqualification thresholds on Medicaid, SNAP, &amp; many other programs, inflationary concerns, etc.

I<U+0092>m open to it but we need to bake it. https://t.co/SuILfjrtz8. People have harped on me about <U+0093>Trojan horse<U+0094> comments I<U+0092>ve made before abt UBI policies,but seriously: not every UBI policy is created equal.

Some are structured in predatory ways to gut the safety net &amp; reward banks, others are better w/people<U+0092>s well-being in mind. Be careful.. Cash is important but if you do it w/o payment suspensions then it<U+0092>s still everyday people footing the bill.

Corporations, lenders, and banks need to do their fair share.

UBI shouldn<U+0092>t be used as an excuse for not pausing mortgage &amp; student loan payments, halting interest, etc. https://t.co/aYvDMbXtYQ. These proposals should be handled with care and consideration, particularly with respect to macroeconomic effects.

But they should be considered nevertheless.

Other countries are getting by w/ payment suspensions, which also creates that cash buffer. https://t.co/2QPSNq5bR0. One way or another we are going to have to address liquidity shock that Americans are facing.

Whether it<U+0092>s UBI, mortgage/rent/loan suspensions, or other means, if we do not act quickly many people will go hungry, be driven out of their homes, or confront other extreme harms.. GOP &amp; Democrats are both coming to the same conclusion: Universal Basic Income is going to have to play a role in helping Americans weather this crisis.

@RoKhanna &amp; @TimRyan<U+0092>s proposal goes up to $6,000/mo depending on need. Mitt Romney just came out for a flat $1,000 universal. https://t.co/43d4AWK70u. Don<U+0092>t say you support a fracking ban when you don<U+0092>t. Don<U+0092>t say you didn<U+0092>t write the bankruptcy bill when you were one of it<U+0092>s biggest champions. Don<U+0092>t say you supported ending Hyde a long time ago when you were just pressured into it last year.

This is basic. The truth matters.. While political leaders are quick to point fingers at other countries, they still continue to champion TRADE DEALS w/ no emission standards.

When Bernie brought up climate in a previous debate on trade, he was chastised. He takes climate change seriously. Other policies do not.. $1.7T is not enough to tackle climate change.

Inadequate climate plans are a form of denialism over how bad this problem really is.

My generation &amp; future ones will have to contend with the horrifying mess that the cowardly leadership of previous ones left us. It<U+0092>s a betrayal.. 40% of Americans can<U+0092>t afford a $400 emergency, &amp; that<U+0092>s before COVID.

The faster we addresses wage &amp; rent concerns for people &amp; small businesses, the faster we can get everyone to self-isolate.

People are going to work &amp;small biz are staying open bc they<U+0092>ll go under otherwise. https://t.co/tELvZ0uiko. Last night on a tip-off call I headed to LaGuardia airport &amp; intercepted @ICEgov transporting several children to NYC, an outbreak hub, via commercial air.

If the Pentagon has halted all domestic travel for military, why is ICE transporting unaccompanied children in a pandemic?. On rent we need to impose eviction moratoriums immediately as an emergency measure, but that<U+0092>s not enough. We need to determine medium-term relief solution to offset a pending ripple of missed rent/mortgage payments. /2. Chef Chang is absolutely right.

Fed gov needs to take decisive action NOW to protect restaurant workers, small businesses, &amp; other vulnerable workers.

We need tackle solutions to stabilize liquidity re: rent &amp; wages.

On wages we shld move on UBI &amp; real paid leave. /1 https://t.co/c2LbmgHNdQ. @jonfavs (The merit of the political strategy of the Dem fight is a different question - we should force the GOP to publicly defend their indefensible positions more and in real time, imo.). @ErikaKlash @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand Great. If you have trouble getting through, I<U+0092>ll leave my DMs open to you - send me a message &amp; I<U+0092>ll connect you w/ someone on our team.. @jonfavs Original Dem version is here: 
https://t.co/dZEPTznOZP

Summary of that original version here: 
https://t.co/RIUDlAicGJ. @jonfavs Dems presented a much stronger bill. GOP/WH held it hostage for ~two days and chipped it away.

These negotiations were closed door so it is tough to say who demanded what, but Dems presented their original version so the tracked changes shows the result of GOP/WH negotiation.. @ErikaKlash @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand Hi, Erika - have you verified I am your rep and left a voicemail? We are returning all constituent calls, but due to high volume we must filter out thousands of outside calls nationwide. If your case is falling through I<U+0092>m happy to connect you with a caseworker. DM me.. Our NY14 tele-town hall is starting NOW with experts from:
<U+2705> NYC Dept of Health
<U+2705> NYC Dept of Ed
<U+2705> US &amp; NYC Census Bureau.

You can follow along with the FB livestream: https://t.co/B0AGTA9hwd. The need for social distancing from restaurants only underscores the need for relief for tipped workers, freelancers, shift workers, etc.

Tax credits &amp; unemployment insurance does not help many of these workers - that<U+0092>s a huge segment of our economy.

We need emergency UBI, now.. What does <U+0093>crowded<U+0094> mean?

If you can<U+0092>t stay 6ft away from other people, it<U+0092>s too close. In general, when going outside try to stay at least 6 feet away from others as much as you possibly can.. To everyone in NYC but ESPECIALLY healthy people &amp; people under 40 (bc from what I<U+0092>m observing that<U+0092>s who needs to hear this again):

PLEASE stop crowding bars, restaurants, and public spaces right now. Eat your meals at home.

If you are healthy, you could be spreading COVID.. (If you are not an NY-14 resident but would like to tune in, please do so via our Facebook page. Zoom offers key accessibility services and we would like to prioritize Zoom use for residents w/ accessibility or language assistance needs). @timaree_leigh Right now the bill offers a tax credit to cover paid leave to freelancers &amp; contractors. Dems tried for more but GOP negotiated down.

It<U+0092>s clearly not enough - a tax credit does not address the immediacy of the crisis. We will get another try - PLEASE keep up pressure on GOP. <U+0001F6A8>Attention NY-14

Our Census &amp; Coronavirus tele-town hall is starting at 2pm.

It will be hosted on Zoom &amp; FB Live. Zoom stream will have live closed captioning accessibility &amp; Spanish translation (current tech limits us to 1 language atm)

RSVP info is available @RepAOC.. We have a bipartisan package that passed the House tonight &amp; has been agreed to by the White House.

McConnell needs to bring the Senate back now and call a vote. I don<U+0092>t care if it<U+0092>s a Saturday. COVID doubling rate means every 24 hours represents a critical window. #WheresMitch?. Every minute, hour, &amp; day that Fed action is delayed on Coronavirus puts lives at risk.

The House has been hammering away at a coronavirus relief package. We just called in every member to vote on &amp; pass a deal at almost 1am.

#WheresMitch McConnell?

Taking the weekend off.. Good.

Many other issues aside, I am thankful that @stevenmnuchin1 &amp; the admin are taking pausing student loan payments seriously - it is a decisive move that will help stabilize millions of people.

We should do it now. There is much more to be done, but every step counts. https://t.co/cSyhGneDS5. On the election end, @repblumenauer &amp; @RepDonBeyer are pressing state governments to come up with plans for election continuity to account for coronavirus.

(In 2018, 58% (!) of poll workers were over 60. We have to protect them too.)

https://t.co/8F2wzSRc38 https://t.co/PVQlrWzttj. Rep. @JoshHarder is also working hard to help small businesses offering paid sick leave during this time, with a proposal to offer a 90% tax credit on sick leave wages paid out by small businesses due to coronavirus.

https://t.co/FEBOhBaPXs https://t.co/93DGhSC2AM. As a caucus, Dems under @SpeakerPelosi<U+0092>s leadership are currently trying to pass the #FamiliesFirst Act to set up paid leave, extend emergency unemployment, protect healthcare workers &amp; more.

@RepDebHaaland has the update here <U+2B07><U+FE0F>

https://t.co/43xJp5A4sO https://t.co/17eg1nwiHG. Incarcerated people are incredibly vulnerable to outbreak, and many do not have basic soap + sanitation supplies to keep people safe.

@NydiaVelazquez, @RepPressley, @RepRashida &amp; I have launched multiple efforts get plans + efforts together from the FBP.
https://t.co/x0HOUuOSzu https://t.co/rSxepnzZLu. Rep. Tom @Malinowski has been working with insurance execs to confirm that people can fill prescriptions earlier than they usually are allowed to, so they can better stock + prepare:
https://t.co/BNtUnGlm9E. First up: as many of you saw yesterday, Katie Porter did a masterful job in Oversight to get the (hesitant) CDC to commit to FREE testing on Coronavirus <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/4iuv9T3wcZ. There is a lot going wrong with the admin<U+0092>s current response, but I also want to make to highlight some of the progress my House colleagues &amp; I are making on Coronavirus response despite challenges.

(If you<U+0092>re a House member &amp; want your effort added just @ me!)

Thread <U+2B07><U+FE0F>. @dystopia_boring It says right in the tweet that we should pause loan collections - not cancellation (though I support that too, but as a separate policy). That means people would still have to pay it back. 

We can find ways to give working people liquidity in an emergency, too. Not just Wall St. @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden I am looking forward to uniting behind the eventual nominee and defeating Trump. But in this moment we have to be extra mindful of the attempts and flashy headlines that try to get us to jump to conclusions. My DMs are open to you &amp; if you have a Q again, feel free to reach out.. @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden I was discussing youth turnout.

Bernie<U+0092>s campaign tried a strategy of blowing up youth turnout. It worked to an extent, but wasn<U+0092>t enough to get us past the post. What I *was* discussing were the 3 hour waits at polling locations, which can sometimes deter young people.. @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden Hey Fred, I deeply appreciate your work and advocacy on gun reform.

Biden ran a great campaign and won Michigan strongly. Please keep in mind the strong attempts to divide our party at this time- if you look at actual the clip, I did not blame Sanders<U+0092> loss to voter suppression.. I<U+0092>ve been discussing policy responses for Coronavirus, but there is plenty we can also do to care for each other, NYC!

- Check on your neighbors (can be through the door)
- Offer to run errands for the elderly
- Tip (a lot) extra if you can
- Donate to food pantries,shelters,etc. We need to dramatically expand #COVID<U+30FC>19 testing and *processing* capacity.

It<U+0092>s imperative to our public health that everyone who needs a test can get it easily and for free as quickly as possible - no matter whether you<U+0092>re a sports star or a single parent. https://t.co/CbEibvr8r9. @DailyCaller @BretBaier When people say <U+0093>why didn<U+0092>t young people turn out to vote?<U+0094> - It<U+0092>s easy to blame young ppl condescendingly.

We should we acknowledge youth mobilization strategies coming short - but it<U+0092>s ALSO wrong to completely ignore the fact that there are 3hr waits on campus polling stations. @DailyCaller @BretBaier I do not attribute the loss on voter suppression.

Biden bested the night, fair &amp; square. However *anywhere* w/ a multi-hour wait to vote - whether in GA, TX, MI, or anywhere else - is a problem.

Voter suppression primarily targets Black voters, &amp; young ppl can be impacted too.. Hey all, wanted to drop a<U+0001F4DD> for accountability.

I usually don<U+0092>t go on FOX on principle, but misinformation about coronavirus has made me concerned about risk.

As a result I decided to go on @BretBaier to discuss coronavirus response + make the case for paid leave, Medicaid, etc. Want to know one major reason why South Korea has had stellar rapid response and quickly produced &amp; scaled up to 10k+ tests/day?

They have a single payer, #MedicareForAll system.

We don<U+0092>t.

Please remember why it<U+0092>s so important for us to fight for healthcare as a human right.. FYI, the amount that the Fed just injected almost covers all student loan debt in the US.

There is absolutely NO excuse for not pausing student debt collections, planning for mortgage &amp;rent relief, etc.

We need to care for working people as much as we care for the stock market. https://t.co/IT6qZA2gtt. Of course, as we know staying home is much easier said than done.

That<U+0092>s why it<U+0092>s imperative that we pass emergency measures like guaranteed healthcare, paid leave, eviction moratoriums, &amp; more to protect people in the logistics of making that happen.. Right now, the question of social distancing isn<U+0092>t just <U+0093>Could I get sick?<U+0094>; it<U+0092>s <U+0093>Could I unknowingly pass it to others?<U+0094>

You could be around immunocompromised people and not know it. If too many people get sick at once, it could overwhelm hospitals &amp; systems.

So stay home! https://t.co/lSzpG8knW4. This is not the time for half measures.

We need to take dramatic action now to stave off the worst public health &amp; economic affects.

That includes making moves on paid leave, debt relief, waiving work req<U+0092>s, guaranteeing healthcare, UBI, detention relief(pretrial, elderly, imm). I find it amusing that GOPers stalk my livestreams to obsess over any &amp; every word, bc I<U+0092>m *actually available* to constituent Qs at 10pm after a long day.

Meanwhile, many GOP electeds hide from constituents &amp; avoid town halls. Maybe that<U+0092>s why they<U+0092>re so preoccupied w/ mine <U+0001F481><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>. Some are taking about <U+2B06><U+FE0F>unemployment insurance, &amp; while good it<U+0092>s not nearly enough. There are enormous sectors of our economy (tipped workers, freelance, shift workers) who may not be <U+0093>unemployed<U+0094> but whose lives are still dramatically disrupted to the point of eviction, etc. Right about now would be a great time to weigh emergency measures like:
- Extending Medicare/Medicaid coverage to all
- Eviction freezes
- No-strings UBI programs
- Eliminating work requirements for SNAP &amp;other assistance
- Humanitarian provisions in prisons &amp; decarceral policies. There<U+0092>s a lot of talk about online toxicity, but @IlhanMN has quietly dealt with more threats in the last year+ than most people really even know of.

Threats to our safety have been a huge part of our lives since we won our primaries. And yet she still shows up w/ this grace <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/C5NHsnEPC3. (We are preparing community updates and following up on important questions - want to ensure we<U+0092>re covering most people<U+0092>s questions and concerns!). @tmccarthyv94 @gatesfoundation @cdc You have my word that I will. For now, the city has advised our seniors to take extra precautions and practice social distancing (stay away from crowds, unnecessary travel, etc). If you need any help, feel free to call my office! I would be happy to visit them myself as well :). If it helps at all Rep. Gosar, you get roasted in committee almost every week so that<U+0092>s kind of the same thing https://t.co/FgNrT5MqzV. @tmccarthyv94 @gatesfoundation Hey there <U+0001F44B><U+0001F3FD>  It<U+0092>s a noble use of<U+0001F4B0>, although I do not believe charity can fix runaway income inequality, nor shld it replace paying taxes to fund the CDC/NIH or policies like paid sick leave or guaranteed healthcare. Billionaires aren<U+0092>t a personal thing, it<U+0092>s a structural thing!. We must support the Dem nominee no matter who it is. Sharing a message otherwise widely on TV needs to be corrected.

(Some folks are taking issue with the word choice of <U+0093>camp<U+0094> - I apologize if the term is unclear. This is a campaign outreach lead &amp; convention delegate.). I am constantly asked if I<U+0091>d support the Dem nominee. Could you imagine if I said I wouldn<U+0092>t?

Yet Biden<U+0092>s camp is on TV threatening to help Trump if they don<U+0092>t get exactly what they want.

This is profoundly irresponsible on all ends. Our country is not a game. Get it together. https://t.co/weMGOCi89O. For everyone who prioritizes <U+0093>consumer choice<U+0094> over a single payer healthcare system, understand that when you force people<U+0092>s access to healthcare to be tied to their employment, you actually take away their freedom and increase the precariousness of their lives <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/1Q6tcLEFum. .@BernieSanders is also much, much stronger with independent voters who we will need in November.

He is a stronger candidate than Biden against Trump. I<U+0092>m not just saying that because we align on progressive policy. I<U+0092>m saying it because I believe it is true.. Bernie<U+0092>s strong record on trade, his exemplary performance with Latino voters, and his overwhelming support among folks making &lt;$40k make him a stronger electoral college candidate.

He can put key Southwest states in play and is stronger in the industrial Midwest against Trump. https://t.co/wrYlN6wJI8. It is admittedly hard to see those who care about civility + toxicity (which I understand) sit in silence about the disturbing antisemitism emerging around Sen. Sanders. A pundit also compared him to a disease on national TV.

It<U+0092>s disturbing. If you care, please care everywhere. https://t.co/hMSJ87Id52. 5 essential accountability questions courtesy of @CJAOurPower:

A spray or cleaner works fine. <U+0001F9FD>
Be well!. If you believe in:

healthcare as a right,
a living wage,
that working class &amp; marginalized people deserve power,
that climate action should be on the scale of the crisis,
that racial justice is key in all this &amp; more,

Then we are on the same team.
Let<U+0092>s accomplish it together.. It is important to fight for the issues, advance your argument, and grow the cause.

To do so, the questions that organizers or anyone seeking to advance a cause or campaign should always ask themselves are: who else can we include, and how can we listen and include them?. Effective organizers are welcomers, natural educators, and positive in their interactions.

They make new people feel like theirs is a movement they want to be part of.

Effective organizers treat the internet as an organizing space (although not the *only* organizing space!).. Lastly, my heart is also full at the candidacy of @cristinafortx whose race is currently too close to call in the runoff for TX Senate.

These women come from backgrounds that typically make running for office inaccessible. They are holding their own &amp; building progressive power. https://t.co/LgbLQT7xpK. Also incredibly proud of Georgette Gomez, who cleared the way in #CA53 and is now on the ballot for November.

@SDGeorgette is a progressive history-maker who fought Trump<U+0092>s wall right in San Diego, and would be the first Queer Latina in Congress. <U+0001F3F3><U+FE0F><U+200D><U+0001F308> https://t.co/AlkMZWT7JY. I am so incredibly proud of Jessica Cisneros.

At 26 years old, she ran for office for the first time to offer TX28 new leadership that fights for workers, gender rights,&amp; a climate agenda.

She stood up to Koch brother money &amp; incumbency, &amp; she came closer than anyone imagined. https://t.co/3NiBVMfDrf. One practice I<U+0092>ve used in no-hand shake situations is to put my hand over my heart and smile/nod at whomever I am greeting. (Shout out to our local NY14 faith communities for teaching me this!)

What<U+0092>s your favorite handshake greeting alternative? https://t.co/xY1rXBjFZ0. It<U+0092>s great to see Republicans understand this crisis &amp; advocate for socialized medicine.

No one should be charged for getting tested for Coronavirus, &amp; no one should be charged for getting treated.

This applies to pandemics and it should apply to any condition or care you need. https://t.co/bpwvIj5sL0. I know the internet can be an ugly place - speaking as someone who deals with a LOT of vitriol - but if your opinion of a campaign is primarily shaped by the internet, try taking a 2nd look at the work and movement-building happening on the ground. It<U+0092>s different &amp; special.. I<U+0092>m a Bernie supporter who builds with Warren supporters. It<U+0092>s how we got a top-to-bottom progressive ballot sweep in NY14.

Throughout it all, Alessandra &amp; I do town halls &amp;collect signatures together to get each other on the ballot.

We<U+0092>ve got each other<U+0092>s back.<U+0001F49C>#BuildTogether https://t.co/G0QZVbbcDR. On top of the presidential race, there<U+0092>s a whole lot of Congressional seats up today too!

If we do not run a strong, progressive candidate that directly addresses the core crises Americans face, we take a major risk.

The time is now.
Vote @BernieSanders.
https://t.co/rzaKXx0Tk6. There will always be people who make the case against transformative change.

But today our generation<U+0092>s prospects are worse off than our parents<U+0092>. Today people are dying bc they can<U+0092>t afford insulin. Today the for-profit caging of people is normal.

I, for one, choose change.. And while folks on TV went on about how we don<U+0092>t need substantive change in America because things <U+0093>aren<U+0092>t that bad,<U+0094> I couldn<U+0092>t help but feel lied to.

Mountains of student debt.
Friends working multiple jobs just to afford rent.
Not one person I worked with had insurance.
/3. I understand disaffected voters because I once was one.

As a waitress, I<U+0092>d watch pundits on TV talk about how we didn<U+0092>t need to improve the ACA much when almost no one I knew could afford insurance. Or they<U+0092>d talk about how great the economy was when everyone I knew struggled./2. To defeat Trump, it is going to take progressive, mass-movement politics that expands the electorate and fights for working-class &amp; marginalized people.

Turning back the clock may sound appealing to some, but we must recognize how we got here in the first place.. @RjBklyn @stpatsforall Abigail did a great job advocating for Hannah and sickle cell patients everywhere. She made our community so proud today! <U+0001F49C>. I know buying a mask might feel productive to some, but if you don<U+0092>t wash your hands WELL, still touch your face, etc it<U+0092>s not doing much for you.

Right now the people who need masks are healthcare providers and patients w/ health needs. Consult your Dr.

&amp; Wash your hands! <U+0001F9FC>. I noticed going home that some people were wearing face masks but touching their face, not using sanitizer stations before eating in public, etc.

Everyone:
Wash your hands.
Don<U+0092>t touch your face.
Wipe down your cell phone.

A judge ruled stop and frisk unconstitutional. Bloomberg fought for *years* defending the policy, and only reversed course when he decided to run for president.. I used to work in the food industry.

I can<U+0092>t tell you how many times the people who handle your food - who are already overworked &amp; underpaid - show up sick to work because our country refuses to guarantee healthcare or paid sick leave.

We need #MedicareForAll.. Don<U+0092>t be that person who talks a big game on the internet but can<U+0092>t keep that same energy in person <U+0001F602>

Just be yourself! https://t.co/YhzYsr6rDF. Had an great time with @breakfastclubam - you can catch this morning<U+0092>s interview here: https://t.co/H2xLw2NtpU https://t.co/sTJM8ViCVz. I hope folks listen to what Anand is saying here.

Mass movements are beginning to transform our political landscape in a way we haven<U+0092>t seen in a long time.

This kind of politics is an important shift away from saviorism. It<U+0092>s not about <U+0093>the one<U+0094> - it<U+0092>s about the many. #NotMeUs https://t.co/sgOCXHz91L. This isn<U+0092>t about swing seats or pushing communities <U+0093>too far left.<U+0094>

It<U+0092>s about accountability. Working families deserve so much better. And if we aren<U+0092>t willing to admit where we can do better, then what is the point?

Our job is to serve the people, not the powerful.. For those upset about critique of establishment politics:

There are D reps in SAFE blue seats who side w/ the NRA, are anti-LGBT+, and yet are protected because they advance the interests of big donors, Wall St, fossil fuels, etc.

It<U+0092>s not <U+0093>wrong<U+0094> to take that on and do better. https://t.co/0Frl0vPlap. After our town hall on the Census in Corona, some of us grabbed a bite to eat at Boca Chica and someone in the community called in a serenata  <U+0001F3B6><U+0001F495>

Our community has so much beauty and talent bursting from every corner. Listen to their amazing voices! <U+0001F62D> https://t.co/1QN3UvZFRo. Mind you this is also important because immigration and progressive ag issues are where many Dems get scared.

Bernie doesn<U+0092>t. His immigration plan is next level - read it. And next time, ask yourself why Latinx communities are so often treated as disposable in Washington.. Over &amp; over again, I hear insider consultants say that investing in Latinx outreach is a <U+0093>waste of time.<U+0094>

When I ran, people TOLD me <U+0093>not to bother<U+0094> with my own community.

Bernie takes Latinx outreach seriously. He was often the only 1 showing up to Iowa satellite caucuses,too. https://t.co/BkpnR8evbS. Do you know who<U+0092>s one of the most undercounted communities during the Census?

Children under 5!

Double check that you<U+0092>ve included newborns and small children in your home when your Census form comes in starting March 12 <U+0001F5D2>

Tempted to do a <U+0093>woman on the street<U+0094> bit and wait outside the Republican cloak room to ask each GOP Congressman how much their tailored suits cost <U+0001F3A4>. Yep! I rent, borrow, and thrift my clothes. (It<U+0092>s also environmentally sustainable!) <U+0001F30E>

The Post is just mad that you can look good fighting for working families.

Sequins are a great accessory to universal healthcare, don<U+0092>t you agree? <U+2728><U+0001F609> https://t.co/xdQ65lbpXe. It<U+0092>s time to elect a progressive majority in Congress accountable to strong, grassroots movements that push support for issues like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, racial justice, &amp; more.

It<U+0092>s time to elect public servants with the Courage to Change: https://t.co/K6JXmCH2Vh. Today @CouragetoChange is announcing its first endorsements of newcomers to Congress:

Cristina Tzintz<fa>n Ramirez (TX)

https://t.co/sbSKTipijm. One major reason I support Bernie is his consistency when things are hard.

Not only does Bernie reject corporate money in 2020, he<U+0092>s also never taken corporate lobbyist money in his *entire political career.*

He is a real one. And in politics, that is nearly impossible to find. https://t.co/GQba01HnEa. (And I<U+0092>m not necessarily asking as a critique, I<U+0092>m genuinely curious. Doesn<U+0092>t taking this position automatically invalidate whoever comes out on top if they don<U+0092>t clear 50%?). Yeah, I<U+0092>ve been sitting with this.

Genuinely asking, if your candidate - Biden, Buttigieg, Warren, Klobuchar etc - clearly had the most votes and the most delegates, why shouldn<U+0092>t they be the nominee?

And what do folks envision as a fair and just alternative in doing otherwise? https://t.co/Tffc8R45uH. It<U+0092>s truly time to retire the misogynist trope that angry men are powerful, yet angry women are unhinged.

It<U+0092>s such gaslighting nonsense. You SHOULD be mad at abuse of power. The real question is how one channels that energy into positive change that creates justice.. Warren was not mean, nor angry.

She was effective.

And by the way, we are allowed to be angry about racial profiling. You<U+0092>re allowed to be angry about sexual harassment. Or at big banks committing fraud against single parents.

Anger at injustice is quite appropriate. https://t.co/LIUpF7L9Sm. Yes, let<U+0092>s talk about pensions - like how private equity groups load a ton of risk from unethical practices on the pensions of teachers, nurses, &amp; public servants - so that when a bubble pops, it<U+0092>s working people that are left holding the bag.

https://t.co/RZuJ25qEya https://t.co/4GzuPZETcr. Ironically, the reason many tech platforms have created billionaires is bc they track you without your knowledge, amass your personal data&amp; sell it without your express consent.

You don<U+0092>t own your data, &amp; you should. And btw, the internet was created w/ publicly funded research. https://t.co/dcCzZKmbzh. (&amp; if not this way, acquiring a billion dollars can also happen via monopoly power, low wages, rent-seeking behavior, not paying fair share of taxes, etc). We can work out the logistics, but we could absolutely use far more opportunities for candidates to shine based on substance.. Honestly, there should be themed debates. Doing so educates the public far more on issues &amp; actually serves the purpose of distinguishing who knows what they<U+0092>re talking about +who doesn<U+0092>t.

Climate debate. Foreign policy debate. Healthcare. Racial justice. Labor&amp;Econ. Can<U+0092>t hide. https://t.co/jot1HzKesk. We need worker-centered policies that reign in Wall Street and value work - including a TON of unvalued and undervalued work, like caregiving.

The cost of system that concentrates a billion dollars in the hands of few powerful people is massive, devastating income inequality.. Also, billionaires don<U+0092>t have a billion dollars because they <U+0093>work<U+0094> thousands of times harder than the teacher or the single mom.

They are billionaires because the stock market makes that money for them, which relies on profiteering off insulin, low wages, scrapped jobs, etc.. In a time when ~60% of American workers make less than $40,000 a year, billionaires should not exist.. Fracking is NOT a transitional fuel, and it is dangerous to say so.

Fracking emits methane, which is about **84 TIMES** more powerful than CO2 in contributing to climate change for a generation.

This is not a joke. We either commit to the science or not.
https://t.co/gM7ArxDhgd. @DanteAtkins I think it<U+0092>s bad too, which is why I personally don<U+0092>t think progressives should propose it.

Corporate insurance will push off their sickest patients on the public option while keeping the healthy ones, forcing costs w/o benefits on the public. That<U+0092>s why we should push full M4A.. @neeratanden Ironically, the context of this quote is me pointing out how the failure of ACA negotiations resulted in killing the public option 10 years ago. I think it<U+0092>s an important case study to examine, regardless of where one ultimately lands on the issue.. @neeratanden FYI, I speak for myself as a member of Congress- if I were speaking on behalf of a campaign, I<U+0092>d say so!

2nd I think there<U+0092>s a legitimate convo btwn starting with what you want &amp; starting w/ compromise. I believe a public option is worse than M4A, so we should fight for M4A 1st.. Candidate preferences aside, the integrity of our primaries are incredibly serious. We cannot afford to be pointing fingers- we need to pinpoint solutions.

If the DNC was responsible for security and there were security failures, we need to address that.

https://t.co/ix4cK71v7W. If this reporting is correct, then there needs to be accountability at the @DNC.

Even if the DNC<U+0092>s access to the tool was <U+0093>solely for security testing<U+0094> as they claim, ProPublica found major hackable vulnerabilities almost immediately - which means they didn<U+0092>t do their job. https://t.co/iite96Nq4L. @keeltyc Thank you so much for pointing this out! There is a standardized form backend which is creating this issue. I<U+0092>ll talk to our team to change it!. What<U+0092>s more patriotic: Fighting for the inclusion and rights of *more* Americans, or working to exclude and marginalize fellow Americans based on their identity? <U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8> <U+0001F3F3><U+FE0F><U+200D><U+0001F308>

I<U+0092>ll wait. https://t.co/eYlZi6czAB. Trump is publicly admitting that he is holding Global Entry for New Yorkers hostage in exchange for dropping lawsuits against him and his family<U+0092>s lawbreaking behavior.

This is corrupt, illegal, and authoritarian.

Hope Collins and Murkowski are proud of their vote. https://t.co/I49Ksj7VAm. This was absolutely, 100% a peak experience.

Stop and Frisk was an unconstitutional, devastating practice for the entire city that intentionally exempted White people from harm.

It was one of the most racist policies I<U+0092>ve ever lived through that deeply impacted the entire city.. Will people get their records expunged?

Will young people sucked into the spiderweb of incarceration get their lives back?

Unless there is restorative justice, there is no <U+0093>moving on<U+0094> from Stop &amp; Frisk. It<U+0092>s just a billionaire trying to cover up authoritarian &amp; racist policy. https://t.co/2wv6KO9YJT. @AndrewYang You ran a great race, @AndrewYang. Your campaign focused on the future, and looked like you were having a lot of fun doing it. Thank you for bringing up ideas like UBI and opening a discourse on how we better value undervalued work like caregiving.. @itsgabrielleu Hey, Zaya! We are all so proud of you. Your strength, intelligence, and conscientious worldview is impressive - thank you for being you!. Trump<U+0092>s proposed rule changes put *one million children* at risk of going hungry without school lunch.

He<U+0092>s not <U+0093>lifting<U+0094> kids off food assistance.

He<U+0092>s *kicking* kids off food assistance. https://t.co/ubRcTknK9l. At this rate y<U+0092>all are going to make me start a version of The Pengest Munch for breakfast sandwiches <U+0001F96A> <U+0001F602> https://t.co/ktaamjzs1Z. @yashar People will be aghast at this take but as someone who worked brunch shifts for years it absolutely brought out the worst tendencies in people. Lucrative shift though!. @nhannahjones It<U+0092>s wild that this is still a talking point in a country where the electoral college regularly overrides the popular vote in elections, &amp; the entire Senate is designed to overrepresent smaller, less populated areas over populated ones as a check on the House.. @davidwebbshow @RepAOC @NYPDnews @NYPDShea @NYCPBA This is not my district, but our thoughts are with all officers &amp; people impacted by this shooting &amp; the epidemic of gun violence in this country.

Perhaps you would get less mixed up if McConnell stood up to the NRA &amp; passed common-sense gun safety measures to reduce shootings.. For GOPers who spent this week mocking the poor w/<U+0093>bootstrap<U+0094> jokes, why don<U+0092>t you listen to Ms. Hutchinson<U+0092>s testimony &amp; give one damn reason why we shouldn<U+0092>t have an accurate poverty line in this country.

Unless of course you were talking w/o paying attn to the actual hearing. https://t.co/4YCypOfxpB. @TheNotoriousPHE In a tall glass:
- 1 oz grenadine (or up to 1.5 oz juice from a maraschino cherry jar)
- 1.5 oz Hennessy (for a mocktail, a splash of OJ can work here instead)
- Lemon-lime soda

Combine over ice and pour gently into another glass to mix. Garnish with cherries if you got em <U+0001F352><U+0001F379>. Top corporations routinely pay no federal income taxes. In 2018, 60 of America<U+0092>s top corporations paid $0.

How dare we even think of it. The audacity.. Well, New York elected a bunch of <U+0093>far-left radical socialists<U+0094> and look at what happened. Brokers fees are now eliminated, saving working people thousands of dollars per move. <U+0001F303>

Truly scary developments. https://t.co/t3GWseRk0A. Welcome to the Bronx, where your local Congresswoman will get you in trouble with the MTA and make you a margarita after to make up for it <U+0001F923> https://t.co/ndYJYzWFte. I worked my butt off to get elected against all odds, without any special connections or money. I worked double shifts and wore through my shoes, outspent 10:1 to get elected.

Even w/ all that hard work, it would be narcissistic to pretend I <U+0093>bootstrapped<U+0094> it alone &amp; w/o others.. Question for the GOP: Does starting a business with a 60 million dollar loan from your dad count as <U+0093>bootstrapping?<U+0094>

Does getting a $2 trillion dollar corporate handout from the GOP count as <U+0093>bootstrapping?<U+0094>

Asking for a corrupt president &amp; his friends.. What does <U+0093>bootstrapping<U+0094> mean to the GOP?
That you didn<U+0092>t go to public school?
That you didn<U+0092>t enlist in the military, which is funded by the gov?
That you never got a tax break for starting a business or buying a home?
That your parents never used food assistance to feed you?. I see that the right is worked up that we pointed out the myth of bootstrapping when 60% of the wealth in this country is *inherited.*

But hey, if you think I<U+0092>m hopelessly dumb, try listening to MLK talk about <U+0093>bootstrapping<U+0094> &amp; the racial wealth gap, too: https://t.co/RHdSfzaJzH. Organizing immigrant communities is a whole new level of effort for pol campaigns.

It requires deeply campaigning in several languages. Traditionally it<U+0092>s deemed <U+0093>not worth it.<U+0094>

Yet this outreach is powerful, &amp; extends beyond an election cycle. They will show up again &amp; again.. We went to small towns, &amp; met with farmworkers + meatpackers.

I saw first hand how up to 50% of Iowa<U+0092>s agricultural workers are immigrant &amp; Latino - many of them rural. These families are revitalizing entire towns in Iowa.

Pundits shouldn<U+0092>t use <U+0093>rural<U+0094> as code for race, either. https://t.co/cU1CNiZ9BI. Some of the most meaningful time I spent in Iowa was connecting w organizers in POC &amp;immigrant communities, many of whom were being talked to for the 1st time by a campaign, &amp;admiring their work.

They were ignored as <U+0093>just a small % of Iowans.<U+0094>

Ask yourself why there<U+0092>s resistance to doing so. https://t.co/wlXi3YpKU0. @SHODesusAndMero Wow you all published live polling results within the hour? Maybe we should let the Bronx be the first primary in the nation after all <U+0001F609>. <U+0093>Allies of Trump have begun holding events in black communities where organizers lavish praise on Trump as they hand out 10s of 1000s of dollars to lucky attendees.<U+0094>

GOP will hop on me over the legal definition of a rally to distract from this garbage. They<U+0092>re so predictable. <U+0001F644>. While those responsible for this shadowy behavior will claim that it is legally above board, the fact of the matter is that it<U+0092>s insulting and wrong.

They may not be legally registered as <U+0093>campaign events<U+0094> or rallies, but it should be clear to all what is going on.. I<U+0092>m not <U+0093>making claims<U+0094> that Trump campaign allies are holding events in Black communities to hand out envelopes of cash.

No geographic diff

Even w that lie, 40 million people live in *recognized* poverty.

This is a deeply personal decision for each member to make, and a choice I did not take lightly.

I will be hopping on Instagram Live later this evening to connect with my constituents and follow up with their questions about #SOTU.. After much deliberation, I have decided that I will not use my presence at a state ceremony to normalize Trump<U+0092>s lawless conduct &amp; subversion of the Constitution.

None of this is normal, and I will not legitimize it.

Consequently, I will not be attending the State of the Union.. Everyone, let<U+0092>s take a moment to

If a state/city gets undercounted, then that community will literally get less members (votes) in Congress to pass key legislation on healthcare, climate, criminal justice priorities, etc.. 2) Race is a question because the Census is also used as publicly funded research tool, as well.

Expanding a House majority is critical, which is why I regularly (and happily) fundraise sizeable amounts for fellow members.

I also believe that a Dem majority should be transformative, which is why I give strategically. Seems fair, no?. I give quite a bit to fellow Dems - we<U+0092>ve fundraised over $300,000 for others (more than my <U+0093>dues<U+0094>), w/ over 50% going to swing seats.

But first, naps <U+0001F634> https://t.co/ec8beJTrmZ. @JJ_McCullough I hate to break it to you, but in the US there *are* party leaders with immense, concentrated power (via fundraising and other means), and they DO create enormous pressure to have their caucus members vote in set directions. I know this because it<U+0092>s my job.. In our current primary field, some people treat healthcare as a right, and others don<U+0092>t. Doesn<U+0092>t make you enemies, it makes you different.

Abroad, being in diff parties doesn<U+0092>t mean you dislike each other. It means you acknowledge your differences and come together in coalition.. Yeah, I don<U+0092>t know why people are up in arms about this.

Many other countries have multiparty democracies, where several parties come together in a coalition to govern.

In another country, I<U+0092>d be in a Labor Party like Jacinda Ardern. Our primary field would cover 2-3 parties. https://t.co/rwx0QFOghK. This clip is from 6 months ago.

It should also go without saying that sites like Persepolis (&amp; its PEOPLE) are not only treasures to Iranians, they are gifts to humanity.

They tell humanity<U+0092>s story - that is why authoritarians target them. They want to erase history. https://t.co/C3tx6Wf8mZ. Remember when everyone mocked us for saying that fighting climate change is going to take a WWII-scale mobilization?

Always an honor to march together, @bradlander! https://t.co/zQlzrXxMH0. This is a war crime.

Threatening to target and kill innocent families, women and children - which is what you<U+0092>re doing by targeting cultural sites - does not make you a <U+0093>tough guy.<U+0094>

It does not make you <U+0093>strategic.<U+0094>

https://t.co/8wW8MR4M1j https://t.co/RXq9j3iXee. War is a class conflict, too. The rich and powerful who open war escape the consequences of their decisions. It<U+0092>s not their children sent into the jaws of violence.

It is often the vulnerable, the poor, &amp; working people -who had little to no say in conflict - who pay the price. https://t.co/jlC35MYsQq. 2. Reintroduce &amp; vote on @RepRoKhanna<U+0092>s bipartisan NDAA amendment, which blocks $ offensive action to Iran.

This amendment passed the House w/ bipartisan support not long ago, and was later gutted in negotiations. We can bring it back as a standalone bill.. Congress now has a moral and legal obligation to reassert its power to stop this war and protect innocent people from horrific consequences.

We have two immediate options:

1. Vote on a War Powers Resolution, which requires Trump to attain Congressional approval.

2.. War advocates start off saying <U+0093>we all want peace, but...<U+0094> or <U+0093>it<U+0092>s too late...<U+0094> &amp; frame a pro-peace agenda as na<ef>ve to realpolitik.

Don<U+0092>t give into this gaslighting. The same folks selling us Iraq and selling us this latest provocation of violence. We cannot repeat this cycle.. Right now is the moment to decide if you are pro-peace or not.

The cheerleaders of war, removed from its true cost, will gladly convince you that up is down - just as they did in Iraq in <U+0091>03.

But war does not establish peace.
War does not create security.
War endangers us all.. Last night the President engaged in what is widely being recognized as an act of war against Iran, one that now risks the lives of millions of innocent people.

Now is the moment to prevent war &amp; protect innocent people - the question for many is how, publicly &amp; Congressionally:. This is just the beginning of our new climate reality.

We must dramatically draw down CO2 to save our livable planet.

Due to expansion of the standard deduction, folks who want to claim SALT now need to pay ~$24k+ in state and local to get it. For those families just over that, the benefit may not be as high.

It is! Healthcare is not H&amp;M. Insurance is a complex financial product for the doctor. Costs are skyrocketing largely due to the financialization of our health.

Streamlining our system &amp; covering more isn<U+0092>t a bad thing.. A lot of Republicans are quite upset about critiquing the frame of <U+0093>choice<U+0094> within our health insurance system, with many staying that those who struggle to pick the best insurance option are simply <U+0093>too dumb<U+0094> to know better.

But the complexity of our system is by design. <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/p1R1ejEqO2. And once again, make sure to get insured if you can at https://t.co/oM59nhveTV

Yes, it<U+0092>s a pain. But it is worth it.

I know some folks are bristling at the fact that I am pointing that out, but we have to acknowledge the reality so we can move forward together.. And as someone who has now experienced many parts of the insurance spectrum (being uninsured, underinsured, and adequately insured) I don<U+0092>t see how anyone can think our current healthcare system only needs a 10% improvement or a just few tweaks.

We need #MedicareForAll.. While I am VERY thankful to finally have health insurance, it is a moral outrage that it took me *getting elected to Congress* for that to happen.

The US needs to become an advanced society. That includes establishing healthcare as a right to all people.. Members of Congress also have to buy their plans off the exchange. They are Gold plans that are partially subsidized.

That means I get to <U+0093>choose<U+0094> btwn 66 complex financial products.

This is absurd. No person should go without healthcare, &amp;no one should go through this, either. https://t.co/bIeD71CD5g. And to our constituents in NY - you have until Jan 31st to enroll, but tonight is the deadline for your insurance to kick in on 1/1!

Do it here: https://t.co/oM59nhveTV. For those who can<U+0092>t afford it, I feel you. I went uninsured for years bc I made <U+0093>too much<U+0094> for a subsidy, but couldn<U+0092>t afford ~$200/mo for a $7000 deductible.

A coworker went through her entire pregnancy uninsured.That nightmare is a major reason why I fight for #MedicareForAll.. Reminder: tonight is the deadline for open enrollment - that time of the year we are reminded of how amazing <U+0093>choice<U+0094> is in our insurance system (<U+0001F602>).

For today, get insured if you can at https://t.co/oM59nhveTV

For tomorrow, end healthcare profiteering with #MedicareForAll.. By pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Trump gave up his seat at the table for global climate negotiations a long time ago.

He<U+0092>s a glorified fossil fuel lobbyist sabotaging the effort to save our future. 

Yet he<U+0092>s not the only one - there are plenty more in our gov &amp; abroad. https://t.co/7qY917YUnV. An utter failure.

#COP25 &amp; conferences like it are intended to be actual negotiations to urgently drawdown global carbon emissions -  not cocktail parties to make politicians feel better about themselves as they squash dissent &amp; sell off our futures to fossil fuel interests. https://t.co/cw1B1dtS53. @amber_jane_9 The way it was explained to me was that it defuses fights.

When individuals debate hot button issues in the second person ex. <U+0093>you are hurting people!<U+0094>, debate can devolve quickly as opposed to being forced to say <U+0093>my colleague<U+0092>s assertion of X is insulting to Y community<U+0094>. The House has a full staff of parliamentarians to help members with all of this. It<U+0092>s a very important job!

Another rule is that members aren<U+0092>t really allowed to speak in the 2nd person on the House floor/ in committee.

That is why people who aren<U+0092>t friends say <U+0093>my good friend<U+0094>. Sometimes being a new member of the House feels like being in Hogwarts. There are lots of arcane parliamentary phrases (I jokingly call them <U+0093>magic spells<U+0094>) one can learn to speak on the floor or gain exceptions.

<U+0093>Strike the last word<U+0094> is the magic spell to talk beyond that.

One of the sneaky and most corrupting aspects of lobbying is to court a members<U+0092> staff - especially their chief.

It just happened earlier this year with lobbyists fighting Medicare for All:
https://t.co/Xp3rq8Y1XW. Health insurance costs have gone up *20%* in the past year.

This is the healthcare system of <U+0093>choice<U+0094> that so many politicians are committed to protecting with small, incremental tweaks.

Meanwhile, Big Pharma &amp; insurance lobbyists treat Congressional staffers to spa weekends. https://t.co/58VDRPf7HY. What does a Green New Deal mean for housing?

Secondly, environmental injustice is a major motivation as to why we introduced and wrote the Green New Deal the way we did in the first place.. I go back and forth on whether to go on Fox News.

The main reason I haven<U+0092>t is squaring the fact that the ad revenue from it bankrolls a white supremacist sympathizer to broadcast an hour-long production of unmitigated racism, without any accountability whatsoever. https://t.co/Yn1XZ912f7. This is a big deal.

Thank you @CPDAction for endorsing @BernieSanders for President!

Together we will fight for an advanced, multiracial society that centers the working class.

Thrilled to be in this together <U+0001F339> https://t.co/X9iqpPVjdZ. Yes! And equal paternity/parental leave is just as critical.

Non-birthing parents are JUST as important.We have to end the stigma that only birthing parents should take time off.

It takes a village. Leave isn<U+0092>t only about physical recovery; it<U+0092>s about starting life as a family. https://t.co/QJik9yTOV4. At a bare minimum, we need to fight for 3 months paid family leave in the United States.

Ideally, I believe we should have 6-12 months of paid leave - just as many other industrial nations do.. Puppies aren<U+0092>t separated from their moms until ~8 weeks. Less than that is thought of as harmful or abusive.

One of the most common lengths of US paid family leave is ~6 weeks.

So yes, when we <U+0093>let the market decide<U+0094>on parental leave, <U+0093>the market<U+0094> treats people worse than dogs. https://t.co/Pc14ypHHJF. It really means a lot to me. I know how precious people<U+0092>s free time is, and the fact that Bronx &amp; Queens families choose to spend their time with me to ask important questions is very meaningful.

No one should live in this kind of fear. https://t.co/FT7OG4nJQY. If Republicans were willing to scrutinize billionaires *half* as much as they scrutinize people on food stamps, this country would be a much better place.. - Also, and very importantly, these jobs are for FREE. The public was going to pay $3 billion in public subsidies &amp; millions in hard cash building Amazon<U+0092>s campus for them- NYC residents were subsidizing Amazon tons per job. Now they<U+0091>re bringing work without the welfare.. - <U+0093>It<U+0092>s in Manhattan, not Queens<U+0094>: If you live in NYC, you would know people commute to work. Amazon would not have paid taxes for many, many years and not contribute to fixing our crumbling subway system. So lots of added strain, no benefit.. While we<U+0092>re here, let<U+0092>s clear up some GOP disinfo:
- <U+0093>It<U+0092>s 1500 jobs vs 25,000<U+0094>: The 25,000 jobs figure was a 10-20 year fantasy # from Amazon, not a promise or agreement. In exchange for that lack of commitment, they wanted billions of public $. Their Y1 jobs projection was 700.. @peterjhasson You should know better. That 25k number was an unsubstantiated #, not a year 1 hiring figure. Nor was it a promise backed w/ consequences if it wasn<U+0092>t met.

1,500 jobs off the bat is huge, &amp; a much better deal than paying billions for a fairy tale that would<U+0092>ve displaced many.. Me waiting on the haters to apologize after we were proven right on Amazon and saved the public billions https://t.co/AC64pG0nZI https://t.co/xzCepkX4AV.

A single mother of a 19 year old gets denied food.

A person who needs their car to drive to work gets denied food.

A disabled person whose paperwork is in limbo for months gets denied food.

Nice system you have there.. Or let<U+0092>s talk about food stamps and cars!

This is one of the wildest rules to me.

If you have a busted car that<U+0092>s worth a less than $5k (say, to drive to that work req), it can preclude you from food stamps.

See how these <U+0093>rules<U+0094> start to stack up?
https://t.co/yIc1YblMcR. If you have severe depression (or any number of mental issues), everyday life is very difficult. But it<U+0092>s really hard to get disability status in general for mental health issues.

So if you need food stamps, and can<U+0092>t afford a dr<U+0092>s visit for a diagnosis/medicine, you go hungry.. These exclusionary <U+0093>rules<U+0094> sound great to anyone who hasn<U+0092>t dealt with the actual lived experience. In truth it means paperwork, waiting, &amp; absurdist bureaucracy.

Let<U+0092>s talk about the example of severe depression, which is an elevated risk for people in economic hardship.. The rule ignores the reality of American life.

Plenty of parents who support can<U+0092>t claim <U+0093>adult<U+0094> (18+) children as dependents.

Getting disability status is notoriously difficult &amp;food is an immediate need. What if someone has an undiagnosed mental issue, like severe depression? https://t.co/UzBvF5dY7l. My family relied on food stamps (EBT) when my dad died at 48.

I was a student. If this happened then, we might<U+0092>ve just starved.

Now, many people will.

It<U+0092>s shameful how the GOP works overtime to create freebies for the rich while dissolving lifelines of those who need it most. https://t.co/WOrYvhfPj4. I was in that CBP facility. There were cameras and monitors everywhere. Are we really supposed to believe that every single camera and every single feed in the detention center happened to go offline the day that I and an entire Congressional delegation visited?

I don<U+0092>t.. Of course CBP is saying the tape <U+0093>doesn<U+0092>t exist.<U+0094>

Bc then everyone would see the horrifying conditions I was talking about.

If the full footage was released, you<U+0092>d see CBP officers sneaking photos of me in secure spaces, and migrant women on the floor w/ their hair falling out. https://t.co/jewXpk8bAs. To our friends in the UK: please cherish, protect, &amp; continue investing in your healthcare system!

Once Big Pharma &amp; special interests get their hands on it, it could take generations to regain.

Millions of people in the US are fighting to have a system half as good as the NHS. https://t.co/gPR2oq7ZSw. A combined household income of $100k isn<U+0092>t even <U+0093>children of millionaires<U+0094> territory.

That<U+0092>s two parents making $50k/each. Does that sound rich to you? 

It<U+0092>s not. It<U+0092>s a working family. And just as tuition-free K-12 public school was an option, tuition-free K-16 should be too. https://t.co/LDjVOK3J2C. 5. Lastly, and I can<U+0092>t believe we have to remind people of this, but it<U+0092>s GOOD to have classrooms (from pre-k through college!) to be socioeconomically integrated.

Having students from different incomes &amp; backgrounds in the same classroom is good for society &amp; economic mobility.. 3. When you start carving people out &amp; adding asterisks to who can benefit from goods that should be available to all, cracks in the system develop.

4. Many children of the elite want to go to private, Ivyesque schools anyway, which aren<U+0092>t covered by tuition-free public college!. 1. Universal public systems are designed to benefit EVERYBODY! Everyone contributes &amp; everyone enjoys. We don<U+0092>t ban the rich from public schools, firefighters, or libraries bc they are public goods.

2. Universal systems that benefit everyone are stronger bc everyone<U+0092>s invested!. This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, &amp; it<U+0092>s sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it.

Let<U+0092>s talk about why Republicans are wrong on this.

Just like rich kids can attend public school, they should be able to attend tuition-free public college. 

Here<U+0092>s why. https://t.co/pWprP0qrhG. Hoping everyone is enjoying a warm &amp; happy Thanksgiving.

I am thankful for so much this year: my friends, family, and loved ones; the blessing of good health, &amp; the opportunity to serve our community and country.

Gratitude is a practice! What are you grateful for this year? <U+2B07><U+FE0F>. Look out for those in politics who like to label themselves <U+0093>fiscally responsible,<U+0094> yet only seem to care about the price of justice - not the cost of oppression.

Everything has a price. And an unjust society is far costlier than one that invests in &amp; values all people.. None of the politicians who brand themselves <U+0093>fiscally responsible<U+0094> ever raise concern about rushing to shower ICE &amp; CBP w/ $billions with 0 guardrails or oversight.

None of them ask about how we pay for corrupt contracts or mass incarceration.

Ask yourself why that is.. This is honestly one of the big reasons why the argument about <U+0093>pay-fors<U+0094> in healthcare, housing, etc so often are made in bad faith.

I see decisions made every day that cost the American public billions of dollars a year for bogus reasons and nobody asks how we pay for it. /2. Earlier this year, Congress rushed to approve BILLIONS more $ for ICE + CBP.

I saw members voting YES w/o even a summary of the bill. Nobody cared then how we<U+0092>d pay for it.

Now ICE is setting up fake universities to trap students.

Yet we were called radical for opposing it.. None of this is a critique on lawmakers who dial for dollars - they don<U+0092>t want to be doing it in the first place.

But to change this system, we must push hard to change the corrupting role of money in politics. And yes, those forces exist among all parties.. Our political system<U+0092>s reliance on huge sums of money has many negative impacts, but one of the largest is that it takes lawmakers<U+0092> time away from lawmaking.

That<U+0092>s a feature, not a flaw - the less time lawmakers have, the more special interests can slip in harmful provisions.. Instead, your support allows me to spend hours each day studying issues &amp; exposing abuse of power.

So while Fox continues to laugh that I<U+0092>m <U+0093>just a bartender,<U+0094> I<U+0092>ve spend the whole year studying big pharma, private equity, military contractors, and Mark Zuckerberg<U+0092>s shady deals.. There is, of course, much more time for me to be fully present at my job. 

In Congress, this is a luxury. Since I don<U+0092>t spend hours each day asking for money, I spend a lot more time legislating, studying, &amp; preparing/sitting in hearings.

This has cumulative effects over time.. I intentionally built my campaign to rely on small-dollar grassroots support w/o any corporate $, because I felt that<U+0092>s the best way to be accountable to everyday people.

It has impacted how I work in Congress in powerful ways - ways I couldn<U+0092>t fully appreciate until I got here.. While many try to belittle a progressive agenda that centers working people &amp; the public good, in truth it<U+0092>s more powerful than ever.

I haven<U+0092>t picked up a phone once this year to dial for dollars, &amp; I don<U+0092>t meet w/ corp lobbyists. 

That is the power of your grassroots support. https://t.co/BDxvMETBnS. Public education, libraries, &amp; infrastructure policies (which we<U+0091>ve had before in America and elsewhere in the world!) are not <U+0093>free stuff.<U+0094>

They are PUBLIC GOODS.

And they are worth investing in, protecting, &amp; advancing for all society and future generations.

Sincerely,

It<U+0092>s easy, I just did it, and I<U+0092>ll show you how in this thread <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/ZAioEhI8pL. <U+0001F4A1>Quick Daylight Savings tip: if you worked a late shift last night when the clocks rolled back &amp; had to work an extra hour, make sure you check your paystub this week and get paid for it!

Computers sometimes miss it. Make sure you get paid - don<U+0092>t let your labor get stolen!. Ending mass incarceration means challenging a system that jails the poor to free the rich.

Arresting people who can<U+0092>t afford a $2.75 fare makes no one safer and destabilizes our community.

New Yorkers know that, they<U+0092>re not having it, and they<U+0092>re standing up for each other. https://t.co/asvidIe5zV. Being a working person in Congress makes me better at my job.

I can<U+0092>t tell you how many members don<U+0092>t know what it<U+0092>s like to be uninsured, or have to choose between rent and a prescription.

GOP seem to think that being born with a fancy last name is a personal accomplishment. https://t.co/DLDwFsaN8r. Back in the Bronx for our community Halloween &amp; Harvest party! <U+0001F47B><U+0001F383>

Over 600 people in the neighborhood came together to dance, decorate pumpkins, &amp; share treats. (I went as industrial policy heroine Rosie the Riveter <U+263A><U+FE0F>)

Special thanks to @bronxboundbooks for coming through! https://t.co/nMQjf3g3Hv. I say this as a candidate that runs digital ads &amp; believe they can be productive + useful *IF* used responsibly.

People say that tech companies can<U+0092>t fact check, but basic fact checking isn<U+0092>t hard. We<U+0091>re talking abt blocking outright disinformation: wrong vote records, etc.. Many folks have asked whether I believe all social media political ads should be banned outright.

I believe that if a company cannot or does not wish to run basic fact-checking on paid political advertising, then they should not run paid political ads at all. /2. This is a good call. Technology - and social media especially - has a powerful responsibility in preserving the integrity of our elections.

Not allowing for paid disinformation is one of the most basic, ethical decisions a company can make.

The Bad News: I haven<U+0092>t had time to put together a costume :(

Any favorite last minute costume ideas out there? Help!. The climate crisis threatens our way of life, and we must decarbonize our economy &amp; way of life to save the planet.

I wish it wasn<U+0092>t such a bad situation too, but previous generations failed to act &amp; now young people need to deal w the science of our future &amp; create opportunity.. Courageous workers at Facebook are now standing up to the corporation<U+0092>s leadership, challenging Zuckerberg<U+0092>s disturbing policy on allowing paid, targeted disinformation ads in the 2020 election: https://t.co/jDJE7WplVy. This is what climate change looks like.

The GOP like to mock scientific warnings about climate change as exaggeration. But just look around: it<U+0092>s already starting.

We have 10 years to cut carbon emissions in half. If we don<U+0092>t, scenes like this can get much worse. #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/GNvk7DYFJT. Zuckerberg has been justifying Facebook<U+0092>s increasingly disturbing decisions by acting like the company is some innocent, neutral bystander.

But as we discover more info, that is getting harder to believe.

They are making active &amp; aggressive decisions that imperil our elections.. Here<U+0092>s what we know:

- Zuckerberg <U+0094>doesn<U+0092>t know<U+0094> when he/FB discovered the Cambridge Analytica scandal. That is hard to believe.

- After Zuck privately met w/ Trump &amp; far-right, he<U+0092>s now allowing paid disinformation ads.

- He didn<U+0092>t tell the whole truth abt his <U+0093>fact checkers<U+0094> https://t.co/CVO0XoWJO1. There are several aspects to Zuckerberg<U+0092>s answers on Cambridge Analytica, paid disinformation ads, &amp; Facebook<U+0092>s ties to the far-right that aren<U+0092>t adding up.

There may be a deeper story here, and we need to get to the bottom of it - the integrity of our elections are at stake. https://t.co/tSqxxSOE0h. Progressive policies as an Ariana dance party:

There have been many aspects of the GOP<U+0092>s little flash mob that have relied on mountains of entitlement and privilege, but them *asking* the police to be arrested is just...

Well, let<U+0092>s just say my community would find it hard to understand why *anyone* would ask to be arrested. https://t.co/ez5IsocNm5. Rep. Mooney, you &amp; I both know that when a massive crime is committed, the 1st step is to separate witnesses &amp; get their stories to see what adds up.

You know that making these depositions public will help potential criminals line up their testimony.

Why do you want to do that? https://t.co/PvIPHTah2V. What<U+0092>s worse: since many of the flash mob already sat on the committees, they *knew* how serious a breach it was to bring devices into SCIF &amp; did it anyways.

Our country is a game to them. Remember that the next time they use <U+0093>natl security<U+0094> as an excuse for their bad ideas. https://t.co/N5qqQlS4ed. Important to remember that GOP&amp;Dem members have been part of impeachment depositions this whole time.

All you need is to sit on the relevant committees.

If these guys are so mad, maybe they should take their little flash mob to the @GOPLeader who didn<U+0092>t assign them to the task. https://t.co/c8arhzmqwi. @waltshaub @brian_wooley Twitter separates your DMs into two inboxes - one from people you follow/talk to and one from strangers. So worry not! I also have the quality filter on, so that<U+0092>s getting stress-tested to say the least. (That said, your question is more likely to be read if you comment instead because RIP my DMs for real. The things we do in the name of public service). Many of you have commented with <U+0093>DM me<U+0094> - so I am opening my DMs for tonight and tomorrow for question recommendations.. Hypothetically, if you were, say, a member of Congress sitting on the Financial Services Committee given 5 minutes to question Mark Zuckerberg, what would you ask? <U+0001F914>. It is atrocious that the President would refer to one of the most horrifying, violent practices of white supremacists to pretend he is a victim of anything but his own actions.

Take this moment to learn abt this dark history,&amp; why we should support the Commission on Reparations. https://t.co/UKmMdy7h0c. If you take time to get to know @JCisnerosTX, you<U+0092>ll understand how important her voice would be to Congress.

Back in the day I used to organize &amp;work w families in her community. This South Texas district is quite close to my heart.

Check out her story: https://t.co/F9Bc2kUyvu. Last year, NY-14 elected me as the youngest woman to serve in Congress.

Let<U+0092>s help Jessica Cisneros shatter that record in 2020.

@JCisnerosTX is a powerful, progressive fighter. Her win will get us closer to a more just America.

I<U+0092>m proud to support her:https://t.co/lOmKzTCuYF. Juli<e1>n is a powerful presence in this race. I<U+0092>m really proud of him &amp; how he consistently uses his platform to uplift &amp; center issues that are wrongly marginalized, like homelessness+police violence.

Some folks try to make primaries vicious. In truth, we<U+0092>re all in this together. https://t.co/3KXEloMbFI. Fun fact: @RepKatiePorter is the bomb &amp; she<U+0092>s also one of the funniest members of Congress.

She<U+0092>s a champion for working families &amp; bravely holds down progressive values from a swing seat, showing that it<U+0092>s a winning cause.

Support her if you can: https://t.co/JrQdwAQS9k https://t.co/GovuanBMfN. A lot of people think that folks like your typical lawyer or doctor are in <U+0093>the 1%.<U+0094>

That may be bc it<U+0092>s hard to conceive how bad runaway inequality has gotten.

Even this number - $500k - reflects top income, &amp; even THAT doesn<U+0092>t hold a candle to recognizing concentrated wealth. https://t.co/1L4ITfryEk. @bradlander @TeamWarren @BernieSanders Thanks, @bradlander! We should all be grateful to have such strong, progressive leadership to choose from.

For many it<U+0092>s a tough choice precisely because of how great they are. I<U+0092>m confident we will all come together on the other side stronger than ever <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F49C>. @neeratanden @HillaryClinton Hi Neera!

I<U+0092>m deeply thankful for Sec. Clinton<U+0092>s leadership and role in the establishment of CHIP.

I am also looking forward to fighting for an America that treats healthcare as a right for *all* people, regardless of their age, income, or background, with #MedicareForAll. <U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8><U+270C><U+0001F3FD>. Today I am endorsing Senator @BernieSanders for president.

In the end, we must come together to defeat Donald Trump. We should do so knowing he is a symptom of a larger problem - and our greatest hope is a multiracial, working class movement in the United States of America. https://t.co/9fiTS7FTX9. Hey all!

We<U+0092>re having a big ol<U+0092> NYC party tomorrow &amp; everyone<U+0092>s invited.

Thousands of people are RSVP<U+0092>d. All are welcome.

(Not sure who you<U+0092>re going to support yet? That<U+0092>s great! Come on in, listen to people in the movement, &amp; learn more about the future we<U+0092>re fighting for.) https://t.co/GiKM3FFEz5. <U+0093>Thank you for asking, bc not many people have asked if I<U+0092>m ok.<U+0094>

Sudden prominence is a very dehumanizing experience. There<U+0092>s a part of your life that you lose, &amp; it later dawns on you that you<U+0092>ll never get it back.

The people who treat you like a human make all the difference. https://t.co/w0XUI4O3bD. The President of the United States is using the language of ethnic cleansing.

If we allow him to continue, who would he use it on next? https://t.co/waSuNK2n3y. A devastating loss for our country.

Chairman Cummings was a giant: a universally respected leader who brought profound insight, commitment, and moral fortitude to Congress.

His guidance and vision was an enormous gift. I will forever cherish his example. May he rest in power. https://t.co/D0RsKsM5fh. <U+0093>This president is caging kids at the border while letting ISIS go free.<U+0094>

@JulianCastro coming with the straight up truth.. Thank you! There are too many plans out there that seem more interested in protecting corporate profits than protecting the lives of working Americans.

We need #MedicareForAll, and we need it now. https://t.co/Te8c8g0tJS. Both rationality &amp; emotion are inextricable to good leadership, which balances the two.

If a person doesn<U+0092>t feel urgency in their gut when communities are poisoned or when a young man dies bc he couldn<U+0092>t afford price-gouged insulin, then they shouldn<U+0092>t be in politics. At all.. It is time we trash the idea that empathy = leadership weakness.

When people hurt, we should hurt too. That<U+0092>s what good leaders do. It adds urgency &amp; humanity to our decision making. Suppressing emotion can lead to aggression, impulsivity, &amp; other erosions of leadership ability.. You know, maybe one of the actual problems w/ our politics is that too many politicians don<U+0092>t feel anything when Americans die bc they can<U+0092>t afford medicine, or when babies are permanently separated from parents.

GOP only has tears for billionaires &amp; outrage towards <U+0093>others.<U+0094>. Trump: sexually assaults women, impulsively allows Kurds to be murdered, boosts videos of shooting journalists

GOP: Aha! Letting your voice shake after seeing 1st-hand human rights violations at the border+ understanding climate stakes makes women <U+0093>too emotional<U+0094> for politics <U+0001F644> https://t.co/9r6BZu0cMw. Small-dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttegieg insults here as <U+0093>pocket change,<U+0094> out-fundraise him by millions.

Our nation<U+0092>s leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it.

Spending the day in Denmark after C40, enjoying this social democracy that treats healthcare &amp; education as rights, zero-carbon as priority, &amp; infrastructure as a key public good.

Here<U+0092>s to another year of fighting for our future.<U+0001F49C> https://t.co/t2jfzNZPTe. This is how the powerful and the predatory are protected: by their friends and allies commanding powerful organizations; by people willing to accept their money or status in exchange for boosting their reputation; and by those too eager to look the other way. https://t.co/562CayQvR0. For working people.
For the poor.
For jobs.
For justice.
For peace.
For prosperity.
For economic mobility.
For society.
For our planet.

We fight for a #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/9Ya8iNNYE3. (The truth is, the GOP loves spending the public<U+0092>s money - but only when it<U+0092>s to benefit themselves, the very wealthy, &amp; their industry friends. See: oil subsidies, the trillion-dollar GOP tax scam, etc, etc). The real tea is that Jeff Sessions gets publicly subsidized haircuts to look as self-made as possible before telling everyone else to lift themselves up by their bootstraps.

Wonder how many other Republicans do the same?

<U+0001F375><U+0001F375><U+0001F375> https://t.co/sfbyNCxZOA. Won<U+0092>t you look at that: Mike Pence used *taxpayer funds* - not personal ones - to spend several thousand haircuts<U+0092> worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses.

I wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman<U+0092>s cut &amp; color. https://t.co/xBze4obZhv. 40 million Americans live in poverty under today<U+0092>s extreme inequality, yet the right-wing want you to blame Democratic socialism for their own moral failures.

Our policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people.

They<U+0092>re just mad we look good doing it <U+0001F481><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> https://t.co/l9gKGtyKra. Wishing all our neighbors and loved ones observing #YomKippur an easy and meaningful fast. G'mar Chatimah Tovah.. Trump decision isn<U+0092>t about drawing down US military involvement at all. 

Remember that earlier this year, Trump VETOED Congress<U+0092> attempt to end US involvement in the Yemen War.

He has significant personal financial conflicts of interest in this situation, among other concerns. https://t.co/ODpoyZI83r. Federal govs are failing to act on the climate crisis.

We can<U+0092>t wait for others to lead.

That<U+0092>s why I<U+0092>m in Copenhagen w/ C40 mayors, trade unions, youth climate strikers, business &amp; citizen reps from around the world to rally for a Global #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/uJjcrkjbTH. I was in a conversation*this year* w/ many people in the room &amp;one guy asked if he could rescind a job offer if he found out a candidate was pregnant.

In my early 20s I was told that if I got engaged, don<U+0092>t wear the ring to interviews to better my odds.

This is *present day.*. Trump<U+0092>s sudden withdrawal from northern Syria &amp; endorsement of Turkey<U+0092>s actions could have catastrophic consequences &amp; risks laying the ground for immense violence and suffering.

We can pursue a strategy to stop our endless wars without endangering the lives of innocent people. https://t.co/N2YWjEGveX. When Republicans say our nation<U+0091>s laws are <U+0093>just a joke,<U+0094> they mean it.

They treat our country as a joke, our communities as a joke, and our future as a joke.

For the GOP, as long as the rich get richer, they are happy to play games with American lives. https://t.co/y8TRhgeHkG. Not stingy. Broke.

And low wages, poor work standards, high cost of living, &amp; a runaway student loan crisis have everything to do with it. https://t.co/rmSaALnQkZ. Lastly, people tend to say <U+0093>what do you do with all the violent people?<U+0094> as a defense for incarcerating millions.

Our lawmaking process means we come to solutions together, &amp;either way we should work to an end where our prison system is dramatically smaller than it is today.

/4. Secondly, our prison &amp; jail system is so large bc we use them as de facto mental hospitals, homeless shelters, &amp; detox centers instead of *actually* investing in... mental health, housing, edu, &amp; rehab.

If we invested meaningfully, what do you think would happen to crime?

/3. First of all, many people in jailed or in prison don<U+0092>t belong there at all. 

Whether it<U+0092>s punitive sentencing for marijuana possession or jailing people for their poverty &amp; letting the rich free through systems like cash bail, we wrongly incarcerate far, far too many people.

/2. I know the term <U+0093>prison abolition<U+0094> is breaking some people<U+0092>s brains. The right is already freaking out.

Yet the US incarcerates more than anywhere in the world. 

We have more than enough room to close many of our prisons and explore just alternatives to incarceration.

/1. Yesterday morning I spoke with a woman who was thrown in Rikers as a teenager. Put in solitary confinement for MONTHS, aka torture. Force-fed pills.

The conditions were so bad, she too had drank out of toilets.

A cage is a cage is a cage. And humans don<U+0092>t belong in them.. Mass incarceration is our American reality. It is a system whose logic evolved from the same lineage as Jim Crow, American apartheid, &amp; slavery.

To end it, we have to change.

That means we need to have a real conversation about decarceration &amp; prison abolition in this country. https://t.co/9E9NTAmBNi. Even billionaires are saying billionaires shouldn<U+0092>t exist.

I wonder if extreme-wealth worshippers will listen to the point now that those with extreme wealth are saying it, too? https://t.co/1u4dqMZhKG. (I love how GOP pundits are already saying <U+0093>it<U+0092>s not enough to pay for it!<U+0094> even though <U+0093>it<U+0094> isn<U+0092>t even defined in the tweet <U+0001F609>

It<U+0092>s almost as if regardless of the circumstance, the GOP take is: <U+0093>Whatever you<U+0092>re talking about, don<U+0092>t tax the rich - no matter what!<U+0094>). Since the Trump admin is hamstringing the Census, we<U+0092>re stepping in ourselves.

Our organizing must go beyond elections. If you have friends or family intimidated about answering next year<U+0092>s Census, start talking to them NOW.

The stakes are way too high.
#CountMeIn #Cu<e9>ntame https://t.co/JGOauW0v7x. Just when we caught a glimpse of justice for Botham Jean, much of it feels stolen back with the murder of Joshua Brown, a key witness in the case.

My heart breaks for his family and for everyone touched by this tragedy. We must get to the bottom of this injustice. https://t.co/2ik9EhvSeh. The United States doesn<U+0092>t even offer guaranteed healthcare for *its own citizens,* yet wants to demand it from people of other national origins.

Hypocrisy, xenophobia, and barbarism all in one policy. https://t.co/qM1bwztfh7. It<U+0092>s wrong. It<U+0092>s harmful. And his bigotry is reflective of the white supremacist base he relies on for political gain.. Understand that Trump is engaged in deliberate, atrocious, targeted antisemitism towards Chairman Schiff. 

Then ask yourself why no one cares to denounce it - esp when his accusation of it towards others drove full news cycles earlier this year. https://t.co/bjEw6eb7Md. To clarify on that ratio:

Annually, we spend about $17,500 per child on education; and ~$250k-300k per person we incarcerate.

https://t.co/nrngxluqX4. Hey Suzie! Thanks for your question.

Comptroller reported this yr that <U+0093>the city<U+0092>s annual cost per inmate ballooned to $302,296 <U+0097> up from $275,986 the previous year.<U+0094>

Conservatively, we spend 14x more to incarcerate each person than to educate each child:https://t.co/C8Xz4XUMgC https://t.co/JXxwTp4RsJ. With respect to the betrayal of our country, it doesn<U+0092>t matter much how these aides felt.

History will judge them by what they did.

The ascent of billionaires is a symptom &amp; outcome of an immoral system that tells people affordable insulin is impossible but exploitation is fine. https://t.co/fjxKOGIdc2. Zuckerberg himself said:

Some things are worth fighting for. So let<U+0092>s go to the mat &amp; fight. https://t.co/YsZzJpDBtk. <U+0093>If another country came in here, blew up our mountains and poisoned our water, we<U+0092>d go to war.

Reports of violence &amp; torture are extremely concerning, and the blockade from communication and life-saving medical care must end. https://t.co/EHWHIdexwe. It<U+0092>s wild to me how people crawled over my 60 mins interview with a fine-toothed comb to find any word or reason to claim I<U+0092>m unfit for the job, yet here Kevin McCarthy (the GOP Leader!) is a bumbling, sloppy, dishonest mess &amp; his mediocrity is accepted as a matter of course. https://t.co/zx7qlhW9dh. On October 8th, Aimee Stephens &amp; the @ACLU will bring the first trans civil rights case ever heard by the US Supreme Court.

Thank you, Aimee - for your courage to fight for civil rights and the dignity of all people in our country. #TransRightsAreHumanRights https://t.co/MKwh85yi2E. One of the major reasons we don<U+0092>t talk about debt &amp; poverty is shame.

Yet way more Americans are living in poverty than our country wants to admit.

It<U+0092>s time we stop looking the other way on economic abuse, like predatory lending, abusive workplaces, &amp; extortionary landlords. https://t.co/2BidQ9hvQ1. It<U+0092>s an honor of a lifetime to join members of Congress who have been taking the hard road &amp; fighting for justice their whole lives.

Barbara Lee is one of them.

Thank you, @RepBarbaraLee for leading the fight in reproductive justice to end the Hyde Amendment. #BeBoldEndHyde <U+2728> https://t.co/vygRhAmQzy. I truly can think of few things less patriotic, more cowardly, and plainly pathetic + reckless than amplifying calls for civil war within your own country.

This President has never been interested in leading. He<U+0091>s interested in consolidating power with a cult of personality. https://t.co/3hw5tr76x6. Jackson Heights never fails! We were successful in our Momo hunting last night. I had the Mokthuk at Lhasa Fast Food <U+0001F958><U+0001F95F> https://t.co/7KCeBQAunC. Trump Tower used as a piggy bank was enough.

10 incidents of obstruction of justice was enough.

Permanently separating children &amp; parents for profit was enough.

Detention camps were enough.

Muslim ban was enough.

Trans servicemember ban was enough.

Ukraine is beyond enough.. Shana Tovah to our neighbors and family in NY-14 and across the world! <U+0001F34E><U+0001F36F> 

Here<U+0092>s to a happy and sweet new year for all. #RoshHashanah. For months &amp; years, these women endured criticism &amp; death threats for telling the truth.

Yet they still tried to stop blatant corruption as it got worse: diplomats staying at Trump properties, kids dying in for-profit prisons who gave $ to his inaugural cmte, obstr of justice.. Today I<U+0092>m showing some love to @RepMaxineWaters + @RashidaTlaib, who endured the brunt of gaslighting &amp; vitriol for being among the first to recognize WH corruption &amp; publicly advocate for impeachment, making it easier for the rest of us.

People think that<U+0092>s easy. It<U+0092>s not.. To be honest, it should really be @AyannaPressley plus 3 since she is *easily* the best singer out of all of us.

I<U+0092>m just the one holding the wind fan <U+0001F32C> https://t.co/RZtZzS4OiK. This is beyond partisanship.

It is a heartbreaking betrayal of our nation.

The President and everyone involved in this should resign immediately. https://t.co/8JT3PwoxBc. <U+0093>If it<U+0092>s a secret, I<U+0092>ll vote for it.<U+0094>

For a party that brands itself on being so tough, they sure run around DC like a bunch of cowards. https://t.co/8l9ROB7KeA. Not only must Native voices not be ignored, they should be *centered* in a climate agenda.

What does he mean, now? Mitch McConnell hasn<U+0092>t done a damn thing all year.

He literally brags that his office is a graveyard. We passed gun safety in Feb &amp; he STILL hasn<U+0092>t held a vote.. There is almost no excuse for a member of Congress to have not read the whistleblower report by now.

It<U+0092>s a few pages. This is literally our jobs.

If you don<U+0092>t have the commitment to be here and do the work, cut your fancy fundraisers &amp; make the time, or quit.

Yet you<U+0091>re suddenly so quiet &amp; pressed about answering my question.

Are you scared or just punking out? Release the raw video. https://t.co/kkbcsFVg9Z. The full whistleblower complaint has been declassified for the public.

Read it yourself - it<U+0092>s extremely disturbing.

It discusses the President using the power of the US gov to extort foreign govs into 2020 political probes, &amp; WH attempts to cover it up. https://t.co/NuPehrXFPc. Hey @NRA, why don<U+0092>t you release my full, unedited interview?

You know, the one where my first answer to your question was <U+0093>Aren<U+0092>t y<U+0092>all broke?<U+0094>

I think the public would like to see it in full. Releasing it is the right move - unless of course you think it<U+0092>ll make you look bad. https://t.co/kOXfkOERFF. @shannonrwatts @IlhanMN I wish they<U+0092>d release the tape of the full interview. My first response to them was <U+0093>Aren<U+0092>t y<U+0092>all broke?<U+0094> <U+0001F602>. <U+0093>It is not responsible to complain about anything we dislike as <U+0091>socialism,<U+0092> particularly when many of my colleagues across the aisle are more than happy to support billions of dollars in government subsidies + carveouts for oil, gas, &amp; fossil fuel industries.<U+0094>

Bye, @HouseGOP <U+0001F44B><U+0001F3FD> https://t.co/Dseu2V5BIN. Also - what they are calling a <U+0093>transcript<U+0094> isn<U+0092>t even a transcript. It<U+0092>s a collection of notes. This is what they are *admitting* to and it<U+0092>s way above and beyond what is necessary for impeachment.

The President engaged in an outright betrayal of our country.. ""I would like you to do us a favor...<U+0094>

Folks, I am surprised the White House even released this transcript. It<U+0092>s worse than we thought.

The President sought to use the powers of the United States government to investigate a political opponent.

We have no choice but to impeach. https://t.co/teZ8p83GXL. Did you know our Fed poverty line is based on 1955 spending, &amp; the way we calculate it hasn<U+0092>t changed since 1964?

It assumes 1 earner &amp; a mother home full-time.

It doesn<U+0092>t include cost of childcare, geographic cost of living, or healthcare.

Some predict it should be *$38k/yr.* https://t.co/EmyV1TLIk6. Big day!

We<U+0092>re rolling out our next major project: A Just Society.

Because while we must hold this administration accountable in the short term,

We also need to propose solutions that help heal profound systems of economic injustice for the long term.. When it comes to climate change, we are going to pay no matter what.

The question is: will we pay (more) to react and contribute to destruction, or will we pay to proactively defend and preserve future generations?

Look around &amp; read the science. That is the question before us. https://t.co/9K9rsgN1qA. This is a huge deal: one of the first major political party adoptions of a #GreenNewDeal as an official policy plank.

Our future relies on whether our leaders choose to act now.

Thank you @UKLabour and all people in the movement for leading the world with ACTION. <U+0001F339><U+0001F30E> https://t.co/XhhfZzxwpv. Remember: the work to save our democracy is deeper than the Q of Trump.

We must fix the deeply rooted, broken systems that enabled this crisis in our democracy in the 1st place.

In addition to impeachment, we must also pursue long-term changes to keep this from happening again. https://t.co/1c0pbEvEcO. Yes, this is an emergency. We don<U+0092>t have the luxury of time w/ another committee.

Judiciary has been investigating&amp; putting the pieces together for months. Impeachment belongs there.

We must honor jurisdiction, historical precedent,&amp; work done + allow Judiciary to move forward. https://t.co/CM0gXN7T1i. Big thanks to Rep. @JoeNeguse and the local Unitarian ministry who introduced me to Ingrid and her family, and have been fighting hard for her freedom. <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F49C> #FamiliesBelongTogether. Last week, Ingrid Latorre gave birth inside a Colorado church where the local faith community is protecting her.

We met in the church rec room where she went into labor.

If we had a functioning immigration system w/ real paths to citizenship, we wouldn<U+0092>t have to live like this. https://t.co/bnL2zEBrjs. Anything less than a solution on the scale of the crisis is a form of climate denial.

It<U+0092>s time for #GenerationGND. <U+0001F30D> https://t.co/AgnVs06Tag. White supremacy is a fundamentally violent ideology that<U+0092>s been growing at an alarming rate, fueling one mass shooting after another.

It<U+0092>s about time we recognized white nationalism for the major terrorist threat that it is. https://t.co/SixiMWnzdJ. When the public democratically decides to invest in ourselves, in working people, they call it socialism.

When a billionaire-captured government forces the public to pay for their misdeeds at the expense of working people, they just call it the cost of capitalism. https://t.co/nUgMpRBiYB. <U+0093>In many ways, the climate crisis is a product, it<U+0092>s an externality, of our unsustainable way of life, &amp; you don<U+0092>t fix that with a solar panel,

You fix it by changing the way we think &amp; operate as a society.

We<U+0091>ve done it before, &amp; can do it again.<U+0094>

Thanks for having me, Joe! https://t.co/xyIukFtu8p. @JamesFallows It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It<U+0092>s another to let him.

The integrity of our democracy isn<U+0092>t threatened when a president breaks the law. It<U+0091>s threatened when we do nothing about it.

The GOP<U+0092>s silence &amp; refusal to act shouldn<U+0092>t be a surprise. Ours is.. At this point, the bigger national scandal isn<U+0092>t the president<U+0092>s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party<U+0092>s refusal to impeach him for it.. We are being invited into people<U+0092>s homes. One woman just showed me her recent blood test, which is sky-high in benzene levels. I<U+0092>m told many others are the same.

Oil and gas co<U+0092>s are going in hard to lobby+dominate local govs. But the community is organizing to fight back. https://t.co/XFZrqfFiVc. I<U+0092>m in Colorado w/ @JoeNeguse visiting communities whose air is being poisoned by fracking.

What we<U+0092>re seeing is appalling. Companies are building fracking sites on public lands, across the street from schools + homes.

Their toxic emissions are invisible. This camera sees them. https://t.co/Kem0MT1lMj. Boulder brought the house down this morning! 

Big thanks to all the Coloradoans who joined @JoeNeguse and I for a powerful #GreenNewDeal conversation <U+2728> https://t.co/YeoRVcskMu. I am currently in Colorado to visit families impacted by fracking sites and to cohost a #GreenNewDeal town hall with Rep. @JoeNeguse.

We are testing new childcare policies on the campaign by covering childcare expenses for traveling parents, or covering travel for children + a partner to join on certain trips.

Wish us luck! https://t.co/caxQ52cQd6. (Certain localities and municipalities did pursue abolition earlier, but none were federally recognized.). The right is pushing back on this. To clarify in 280 chars, DC was the first area where enslaved people were freed by the US government. 

It was enacted by the Compensated Emancipation Act of 1862. 

https://t.co/plbSr7WCkw. I cannot tell you how powerful young people mobilizing their parents &amp; grandparents are in changing the game on issues &amp; elections. We did this last yr &amp; continue to now.

It<U+0092>s twofold organizing: it expands the electorate and flips voters.

It takes multiple convos. Start now! https://t.co/KwJMHgydnr. DC was the 1st territory in the United States to free the enslaved.

It<U+0092>s where Black Americans fled the tyranny of slavery &amp; towards greater freedom, to DC. Yet today it<U+0092>s where 2nd class citizenship reigns, and the right to vote is denied.

It<U+0092>s time to recognize DC statehood. https://t.co/AkfaRHw38C. Today was Puerto Rico Advocacy Day in DC <U+0001F1F5><U+0001F1F7>

Here<U+0092>s what we<U+0092>re fighting for:
1. Full audit of Puerto Rico<U+0092>s debt
2. Cancellation of PR<U+0092>s debt
3. End La Junta and establish oversight accountable to the people
4. A #GreenNewDeal to rebuild PR https://t.co/VVNCYPL6qR. @CynthiaNixon @nytimes There will always be powerful interest in promoting the idea that the left is losing power 1 way or another.

The big way they try to dismantle the left isn<U+0092>t to attack it, but to gaslight &amp; deflate it.

Dripping condescension that I<U+0092>m being <U+0093>educated<U+0094> should be a big red flag <U+0001F644>. And just like that <U+0001F33F> 10,000 farmers + ranchers have come out urging Congress to support a #GreenNewDeal.

From regenerative agriculture + carbon farming to keeping our land hospitable to life, farmers &amp; ranchers know they are key to leading a Green New Deal &amp; #JustTransition. https://t.co/TWj2VBcuVb. <U+0001F62D>

For everyone who feels confused about how to act in 2019, #GenGND is a great example for the world.

GM workers are asking for a raise during a time of record profits. In response, GM execs cut off their health insurance.

Yet another reason we insist on #MedicareforAll: so your healthcare won<U+0092>t be held hostage to negotiate lower wages. https://t.co/iKGqZ0igv5. In America, people aren<U+0092>t paid a living wage, healthcare isn<U+0092>t guaranteed, and educating yourself to skill up will likely put you thousands of dollars in debt.

Republicans only seem to believe in <U+0093>states rights<U+0094> when it comes to denying people freedom and advancing their personal agenda. https://t.co/UujKgOr6ck. This is a real quote from a Democrat representing a safe blue seat.

Aggressive statements like these are so casually thrown from corporate candidates towards grassroots ones, yet they never get branded as <U+0093>divisive,<U+0094> despite their rhetoric.

We should ask ourselves why that is. https://t.co/wb3AOz5285. Marie Newman (@Marie4Congress) is a grassroots fighter for working families in #IL03.

To me, choosing to support is about more than just policy. It<U+0092>s also about who puts in the WORK. Are they wearing out their shoes?

Marie is. Her supporters are. Let<U+0092>s knock doors &amp; join them. https://t.co/jjSy4Anc14. It<U+0092>s going to take a bigger, stronger Democratic Party - one that<U+0092>s returned to our FDR roots &amp; fights for working people - to change our future in 2020.

We can<U+0092>t afford deep blue seats fighting against healthcare &amp; equal rights.

We need @Marie4Congress.
https://t.co/muqbA5cjyk. Remember when we said climate change would cause mass migration, &amp; the right called us crazy?

Well, it<U+0092>s happening. And walling ourselves off from the world isn<U+0092>t a plan for our future.

It<U+0092>s time to recognize climate refugees in our immigration policies. https://t.co/Oo0uyT65ti. Incredibly inspired by GM<U+0092>s almost 50,000 workers for having the courage to strike for the dignified work they deserve.

In a time of record profits, workers should prosper, not suffer.

That<U+0092>s why unions play a key role in an economy that works for everyone.

It is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat.

Because sexual assault isn<U+0092>t a crime of passion - it<U+0092>s about the abuse of power.

He must be impeached.https://t.co/9PhrgeYuHv. Your ability to get insulin or see a doctor shouldn<U+0092>t depend on how generous a billionaire is feeling today.

Employers stripping healthcare, either by taking it away or worsening it, is just part of the casual dehumanization of working people to increase returns for the rich. https://t.co/elxGdz12qN. This is why corporate <U+0093>choice<U+0094> health plans are unacceptable, and why we must fight for #MedicareforAll.

Choice plans are merely a <U+0093>choice<U+0094> of which corporation profits off our crisis.

Healthcare is a right. It<U+0092>s unconscionable that insurance companies choose who lives &amp; dies. https://t.co/Qm71q4MhG8. It is disappointing to see many pundits obsessing over whether one candidate was deferential enough to another, while this crucial moment is barely being discussed.

<U+0093>Civility<U+0094> is too often used as a dog whistle for tone policing, while concerning moments like these get a pass. https://t.co/ySav1ZoDv3. This is a big deal: @NYCSchools is standing in solidarity with the global #ClimateStrike next Friday by excusing absences w/ parental consent.

<U+0093>Comparison of the Dem<U+0092>s ideology to that of the genocidal Cambodian regime is strongly ahistorical. In fact, the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge was facilitated by a Republican president, Richard Nixon, and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger.<U+0094> https://t.co/nrHOvyAFmN. And guess what: if you also believe in a free + open democratic society, where people are treated humanely  and don<U+0092>t die over $300 insulin or needless war, they<U+0092>ll call you a communist too.

Well, they don<U+0092>t scare us or shake our focus.

We are going to build a better world.. Since the GOP will only get worse in their hysteria, let<U+0092>s remember who we are:

We are fighting to guarantee healthcare in America.
To make education and housing dignified and accessible.
To save our planet.
To set living wages.
To establish justice at home, &amp; peace abroad.

/1. GOP<U+0092>s message: No policy, no facts, just displays of violence + corporations like @ABCNetwork &amp; Sinclair who amplify them.

They profit from burning my likeness on TV. But who pays for heightened security? Who answers the phones for the threats resulting from a violent, false ad? https://t.co/Gr1XhEbwDC. To clarify: Rahm Emanuel once mailed the body of a dead, decomposing fish to bully a Dem he disliked.

Then, as a mayor of Chicago, he worked to hide footage of the murder of Laquan McDonald from the public.

Now he<U+0092>s an investment banker &amp; on TV. And all this is seen as normal. https://t.co/XJgL3lQ8ve. Know that this wasn<U+0092>t an ad for young conservatives of color - that was the pretense.

What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP<U+0092>s white supremacist case. https://t.co/zvp1EB02c5. Republicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren<U+0092>t racist.

Life is weird!. Journalists could notes from @jorgeramosnews in the #DemDebate.

He is asking tough, but fair questions - not to stir drama or seek a gotcha moment - but to hold people accountable to their records and have them answer for it.

His clarity makes it thrilling nonetheless.. Weapons of war, specifically designed to kill human beings en masse, should not be available for purchase.. Systemic racism is a root ideology that propped up an extractive economic system that prioritizes profit over human &amp; environmental considerations.

The injustices of slavery evolved into Jim Crow, redlining, the War on Drugs, mass incarceration, &amp; beyond:
https://t.co/ox9co5QkeB. There are certain industries whose lobbying power is bipartisan.

Big pharma &amp; private insurance are huge ones. Their lobbyist influence is rife in Washington and in elections. Know that.. Medicare for All is the best healthcare plan for working and middle class Americans.

It guarantees critical healthcare, like insulin treatments, as a right, &amp; at a lower cost too.

Corporate choice plans virtually guarantee profits for insurers, not healthcare for Americans.. Obviously Bolton leaving is good - it was an enormous mistake to appoint him in the first place. One doesn<U+0092>t need to boost authoritarians to make the point.. Today my thoughts are with 9/11 families - and in our community, the loved ones of Queens hero Det. Luis Alvarez.

Just this year, Det. Alvarez testified before Congress for the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund before succumbing to cancer from Ground Zero. https://t.co/WjFLIk0d4s. When people chastise millennials for not having or delaying starting their families after growing up in a recession, here<U+0092>s one big reason why: https://t.co/IL0l7bgli5. Too often, elite institutions &amp; corrupt people/orgs have a symbiotic relationship: they launder each other<U+0092>s reputations for the illusion of legitimacy &amp; prestige.

In this instance,leaders at MIT<U+0092>s Media Lab knowingly buffed the reputation of a child rapist bc he paid for it. https://t.co/Z8ZWfBW6pH. Remember when Fox News made the grave mistake of actually telling people what we<U+0092>re fighting for?

Ah, memories. https://t.co/RbliPl46Th. Rent has gotten to extortion-level highs in New York City, and there<U+0092>s a whole lot of lawbreaking that happens because so many working people are on the brink.

Housing is a right. NY<U+0092>s rent laws must be enforced if abusive, predatory actors are breaking them. https://t.co/RjeHQ1SURp. As we hammer away at climate deniers, the fossil fuel industry is pivoting to promote bogus climate policies.

You better believe they<U+0092>ll be dumping cash to lobby ALL members of Congress - not just their bread &amp; butter Republicans.

Learn about how they<U+0092>re working it here <U+2B07><U+FE0F> https://t.co/fUy1tpB8Xk. The GOP is continuing their crusade against democracy.

They<U+0092>re so scared that Trump will lose that they<U+0092>re moving to cancel their own primaries.

While the GOP screams that we<U+0092>re <U+0093>elitists<U+0094> for wanting healthcare, they<U+0092>re handing over party control to lobbyists + rich families. https://t.co/l16UngKie6. (Several Dem members have introduced bills to work on issue - @RepSeanMaloney, @tedlieu, &amp; @PattyMurray have all taken swings at defunding and labeling Conversion therapy as fraud): https://t.co/RnC3UHEIhv. Conversion <U+0093>therapy<U+0094> isn<U+0092>t therapy at all. It<U+0092>s a homophobic + dangerous practice that hurts LGBTQ+ people and families.

CT is banned in 18 states. We should ban it nationwide.

(PS: that one of its founders was gay is a glimpse into how homophobia and toxic masculinity works) https://t.co/q6aXjrU7zI. Trump is taking away middle schools from military families, robbing disaster relief from hardest-hit communities,&amp; chopping up people<U+0092>s property via eminent domain for his little wall.

This is a project driven by ego - not a desire to serve and improve the lives of human beings. https://t.co/Rgp0ICOYk4. I<U+0092>m really proud of this interview!

Growing up, Spanish was my first language - but like many 1st generation Latinx Americans, I have to continuously work at it &amp; improve.

It<U+0092>s not perfect, but the only way we improve our language skills is through public practice. #Palante https://t.co/FpGIFSQiRp. We are part of a global community. To combat the climate crisis, we must come together as a nation AND a planet.

The good news: We don<U+0092>t have to wait. We can start now, from the bottom up.

Cities are creating jobs&amp; advancing justice w/ a #GreenNewDeal, as global mvmts mobilize. https://t.co/4O9FbAE3M2. There is no reason any person in America should pay more than 15% interest.

A 15% rate is already very high. We used to ban 8+%. Usury is a shakedown of working people that should be illegal.

If you agree,contact your member&amp; ask them to sign onto the Loan Shark Prevention Act. https://t.co/15pPv8qhmp. She<U+0092>s right.

We all want to, &amp; can, do our part w climate change &amp; environmental justice.

But know that just 3 industries are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions.

&amp; if you<U+0092>re concerned abt money in politics, the fossil fuel industry is a key source of political corruption. https://t.co/8fWrzCYCmu. There is a genre of videos where GOP House members - who clearly didn<U+0092>t read sworn testimony that detention sinks were broken- filming themselves drinking out of toilet sinks.

They<U+0092>re so anti-immigrant they risk pink eye to show off that they didn<U+0092>t do the reading #CloseTheCamps https://t.co/uYLxQqxSej. We need to organize around the Census, and we need to start now.

This morning we were out bright and early catching AM commuters in Corona and share info on #Census2020 <U+0001F31E>

Census is hiring now - and we need NYC organizers! Check it out: https://t.co/c5yXKOZdi0 https://t.co/3pzgAWEIqA. One of my constituents sweetly framed a clipping from our healthcare town hall in City Island and recently gave it to me.

I was looking at it today and realized we had a very cool attendee in our midst the whole time <U+0001F602><U+0001F9E2> https://t.co/Nr5mhT3WiP. Domestic abusers can be master manipulators. Plus, domestic abuse is a HUGE indicator for gun violence.

That<U+0092>s why <U+0093>vouching for friend<U+0094> isn<U+0092>t a substitute for a background check.

You wouldn<U+0092>t lend a car to someone w/o a license.Why lend a gun to someone w/o a background check?. Rapists can have Ivy League degrees. Abusers can look like <U+0093>good dads<U+0094> or have high incomes or <U+0093>great jobs.<U+0094>

Good appearances are often a cover for abusers. In fact, many abusers RELY on their public reputation to intimidate partners from leaving (ex: <U+0093>no one will believe you.<U+0094>). This idea of <U+0093>I know the guy, there<U+0092>s no way he beats his wife<U+0094> as the way we keep guns out of the hands of abusers is ridiculous.

Any person who has been abused, assaulted, etc knows that abusers often present as <U+0093>upstanding.<U+0094>

There<U+0092>s no way you<U+0092>d know. That<U+0092>s why it<U+0092>s common. https://t.co/uuq17HT3Of. Herein lies an important point abt domestic abuse: most of it is hidden. You could know an abuser &amp; have no clue.

I<U+0092>ve had friends come out to me as victims. It<U+0092>s not obvious. Unsafe relationships are COMMON.

That<U+0092>s why House Dems passed closing the boyfriend loophole in VAWA.. You said w/ universal background checks, you wouldn<U+0092>t be able to <U+0093>lend<U+0094> guns to friends.

If a background check would be a problem, then you shouldn<U+0092>t <U+0093>lend<U+0094> a gun.

And btw, NY is one of the safest states in the country when it comes to guns, incl rural areas.

Try to keep up. https://t.co/4RV4DNg7FM. You are a member of Congress. Why are you <U+0093>lending<U+0094> guns to people unsupervised who can<U+0092>t pass a basic background check?

The people you<U+0092>re giving a gun to have likely abused their spouse or have a violent criminal record, &amp; you may not know it.

Why on earth would you do that? https://t.co/TQFjcLQebO. This is what climate change looks like: it hits vulnerable communities first.

I can already hear climate deniers screeching: <U+0093>It<U+0092>s always been like this! You<U+0092>re dim,<U+0094> etc.

No. This is about science &amp; leadership. We either decarbonize&amp;cut emissions, or we don<U+0092>t &amp; let people die. https://t.co/paUHKAp03e. Beyond the moral wrong, racism is a powerful political tool used to dismantle public goods &amp; civil rights.

So long as bigoted sympathies exist (subtly or loud), they will be used. That<U+0092>s why convincing people racism is a sidenote,&amp;not broad or institutional, is a strategic move.. The corruption of Trump - of many admins - wouldn<U+0092>t be politically possible without relying on sympathy for racist policies.

That<U+0092>s what Reagan<U+0092>s Black <U+0093>welfare queen<U+0094> was all about, too.

If people think they<U+0092>re <U+0093>paying for someone else,<U+0094> they<U+0092>ll dismantle their own healthcare.. For example:

By rallying support for super racist immigration policies, (Muslim Ban, concentration camps,etc), supporters look the other way at the billions of public dollars going to private prison CEOs - who then kick some that <U+0001F4B0> back to Trump (ex. his inaugural committee)
/3. Since corruption isn<U+0092>t popular policy, racism works as the cover for the con. That<U+0092>s why addressing racism isn<U+0092>t a <U+0093>distraction<U+0094> - it<U+0092>s key to understanding the hustle against working people. 

Culturally, racism is used as the unspoken cudgel against pro-working class policy. /2. Virtually every policy Trump pursues works to steal public money &amp; personally enrich himself &amp; his friends.

<U+0001F4B0>Gutting National Monuments pays <U+27A1><U+FE0F> Fossil Fuel CEOs
<U+0001F4B0>Border concentration camps pay <U+27A1><U+FE0F> Private Prison CEOs
<U+0001F4B0>Betsy DeVos pays <U+27A1><U+FE0F> loan sharks

It<U+0092>s always about the con. https://t.co/ggINFg52Kw. If people were actually concerned about undocumented people, the clear solution would be to offer documentation. It<U+0092>s safer &amp; secure for everyone.

But there is no <U+0093>law &amp; order<U+0094> in an immigration system of sheer chaos, where rules change every day for the sole goal of exclusion.. About 1/2 of all the cases I see at work are immigration related. Many are people who<U+0091>ve been on the path to citizenship for years.

Steps that are supposed to be ~30 days are taking up to a year. Some, like work authorizations, are so delayed they<U+0092>re forcing people out of jobs.. Some anti-immigrant folks like to say: <U+0093>We<U+0092>re not against immigration, we<U+0092>re against <U+0093>illegal<U+0094> immigration.<U+0094>

If that were true, then we would make documented immigration easy &amp; safe.

But each &amp; every day, this administration is grinding legal, documented immigration to a halt. https://t.co/1YOimdaCK8. Wow. What a moment.

These two women, @Naomi_Osaka_ &amp; @CocoGauff, set an example for the world last night.

This is what it<U+0092>s all about. https://t.co/Ae1vAgnDSV. <U+0093>The retro posters nudge viewers to recall that big, federal-government-led plans have a long history in the U.S...

When people try to mock you personally instead of engaging the substance of your advocacy, it<U+0092>s because they know how powerful you are, and that the truth is on your side.

Keep inspiring and organizing.

We<U+0092>re going to save the planet.
All of us, together. <U+0001F30E> https://t.co/eRgvMYy2uh. Today we<U+0092>re getting all our NY-14 children ready for back-to-school by providing backpacks and school supplies at local parks &amp; block parties!

Tucked inside our backpacks was a special note from me to all our students for the upcoming school year: https://t.co/jGJfRgdwe5 https://t.co/mrr2cxUmlI. Our #GreenNewDeal posters are inspired by the original New Deal, updated for our future.

During the New Deal, FDR launched Federal One, a US project that employed 5,300 artists that created &amp; taught art to envision America<U+0092>s future.

Left, #TeamAOC; right, original US New Deal https://t.co/l3PZzlEhzw. Bronx &amp; Queens art is where we<U+0092>re starting, but we aspire to release custom #GreenNewDeal art for local communities across America.

We are also working on a line of GND reusables!

The first 250 prints will be released at Family Nature Day tomorrow, where we<U+0092>re doing park tours: https://t.co/AMrUX4etG5. These posters push us to imagine our future with a Green New Deal in two of our beloved NY-14 parks: Pelham Bay &amp; Flushing Meadows.

All our #GND posters are made in the US, union-printed &amp; will be available for purchase soon, but available at organizing events now.

/2. Surprise!<U+2728>I am thrilled to announce the launch of our #GreenNewDeal art series with custom Bronx &amp; Queens GND posters.

The Bronx edition poster will be given for free as a limited release to the public at our Pelham Bay Nature Day &amp; Backpack Giveaway in the Bronx tomorrow.

/1 https://t.co/xD4AinKrWi. See? You<U+0092>re a neo-Nazi fan favorite and I don<U+0092>t block you for defending white supremacist viewpoints and mocking gun violence survivors. https://t.co/007audZvgj. People are free to speak whatever classist, racist, false, misogynistic, bigoted comments they<U+0092>d like.

They do not have the right to force others to endure their harassment and abuse. <U+270C><U+0001F3FD>. 1. I have 5.2 million followers. Less than 20 accounts are blocked for ongoing harassment. 0 are my constituents.

2. Harassment is not a viewpoint. Some accounts, like the Daily Caller, posted fake nude photos of me &amp; abused my comments to spread it. No one is entitled to abuse. https://t.co/0QWKqJFzRe. I love everything about this GOP attack ad.

Republicans underestimate my intelligence bc I invite people into my home &amp; talk about policy in plain English instead of DC jargon.

They think that<U+0092>s dumb, so they end up paying for ads that spread &amp; explain our policy positions. <U+0001F923> https://t.co/6XC1YdyKDU. Fmr officials should not become corporate lobbyists, in letter or spirit. It<U+0092>s an abuse of power + a stain on public service.

I don<U+0092>t care if it<U+0092>s a Democrat doing it (both parties do). In fact, that makes it worse - we<U+0092>re supposed to fight FOR working people, not against them. https://t.co/r6DN9mwf3A. The <U+0093>old-fashioned red-baiting approach, familiar to those of us who lived through the Cold War, doesn<U+0092>t seem to be working.<U+0094>

Drumming fear around socialism is the GOP<U+0092>s big play, &amp; it<U+0092>s failing, bc capitalism = GoFundMe as our national healthcare system. https://t.co/IOrDu1VYe0. 3,000 Americans died on your watch.

You<U+0092>re not the best thing to happen to anybody but yourself. And even that<U+0092>s questionable. https://t.co/NEoWUFd9cC. If there<U+0091>s any CEO in the country that I<U+0092>d be honored to go toe to toe with,the CEO of the largest for-profit private prison corporation would definitely be up there.

Guess what, @GEOGroup: your entire business - the caging of humans for profit - is immoral &amp; should be outlawed. https://t.co/72FoiSnpUs. (For real though, it is pretty concerning that this guy abused his position to try to get someone fired over something so insignificant - esp after creating a career defending vile language as a sacred freedom &amp; deriding people organizing for basic human dignity as <U+0093>snowflakes.<U+0094>). Imagine being on Twitter and having the worst thing you<U+0092>re called in a given day is <U+0093>bedbug.<U+0094> My own friends roast me harder than that <U+0001F602>. Well, it<U+0092>s official: Republicans are now arguing that the US isn<U+0092>t (&amp; shouldn<U+0092>t be) a democracy.

This is what they believe. From lobbyists writing their bills to sabotaging our civil rights, the GOP works to end democracy.

In reality, we have to grow it. https://t.co/DWn1uqpAuw. Getting back home after taking a few days<U+0091> road trip - including our National Parks! <U+0001F3DE>

We all should fight to protect the land, *and* so every American can have the ample, necessary time off to recuperate &amp; enjoy it. https://t.co/IaaRG6PFw6. 5) The Electoral College isn<U+0092>t about fairness at all; it<U+0092>s about empowering some voters over others.

Every vote should be = in America, no matter who you are or where you come from. The right thing to do is establish a Popular Vote. &amp; GOP will do everything they can to fight it.. 4) We do not give electoral affirmative action to any other group in America. Do Black Americans have their votes count more bc they have been disenfranchised for 100s of years? Do Reservations get an electoral vote? Does Puerto Rico and US territories get them? No. They don<U+0092>t.. 3) LASTLY, this concept that the Electoral College is provides <U+0093>fairness<U+0094> to rural Americans over coastal states doesn<U+0092>t hold any water whatsoever. First of all, virtually every state has rural communities. NY. California. Much of our states are rural.

But very importantly.... 2) This common claim about <U+0093>if we don<U+0092>t have the Electoral College then a handful of states will determine the presidency<U+0094> is BS.
 a. It<U+0092>s the *EC itself* that breaks down power by state, pop vote decentralizes it

 b. The EC makes it so a handful of states DO determine elections. I see Fox News is big mad about abolishing the electoral college.

So let<U+0092>s talk about it.

1) If the GOP were the <U+0093>silent majority<U+0094> they claim, they wouldn<U+0092>t be so scared of a popular vote.

They *know* they aren<U+0092>t the majority. They rely on establishing minority rule for power.. Folks may want to read extra deep into this, but I say this simply to acknowledge the courage it takes to make a statement like this.

From Warren to Castro to Bernie &amp; others, we are lucky to have the leadership bench we have right now. We should praise all their great moments!. One thing that is completely undeniable about Bernie Sanders is the enormous political courage he consistently wields on behalf of others.

This statement is a big deal. He<U+0092>s not just standing up for two members - he<U+0092>s standing for the integrity of the entire US Congress. https://t.co/dZ8jPIyrLU","before_AOC"
