https   t co lshmkksq via  since when does the lamestream media call who our next president will be  we have all learned a lot in the last two weeks      where it mattered  they stole what they had to steal    u  we believe these people are thieves  the big city machines are corrupt  this was a stolen election  best pollster in britain wrote this morning that this clearly was a stolen election  that it u  s impossible to imagine that biden outran obama in some of these states     and detroit with a long series of election problems  to put it mildly   u        how these ballots were authenticated  because if there u  s a problem in the system about authentication  that would seriously affect the entire election   and what concerns me is that we had over a hundred million mail in ballot in cites like philladelphia        supreme court justice to compel them to separate ballots that were received after the legislative deadline  it required the intervention of justice alito  that u  s a large group of ballots  when you talk about systemic problems  it u  s about     u  we should look at the votes  we u  re just beginning the tabulation stage  we should look at these allegations  we u  re seeing a number of affidavits that there has been voter fraud  we have a history in this country of election problems  in pennsylvania you had an order by a       legal votes  the most ever for a sitting president  the observers were not allowed into the counting rooms  i won the election  got    legal votes  bad things happened which our observers were not allowed to see  never happened before  millions of mail in ballots were sent to people who never asked for them  i won this election  by a lot  georgia counties using same software as michigan counties also encounter

 crudely not allowed  tractors blocked doors  amp  windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms  bad things happened inside  big changes took place      this would also change the election result in numerous states  including pennsylvania  which everyone thought was easily won on election night  only to see a massive lead disappear  without anyone being allowed to observe  for long intervals of time  what the happened    tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after  p m  on tuesday  election day  totally and easily changing the results in pennsylvania and certain other razor thin states  as a separate matter  hundreds of thousands of votes were illegally not allowed to be observed    incredibly stated jim  https   t co fnbz  u  we need an explanation as to how these numbers have been running up for the last two or three days  u   matthew whitaker   i had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night  only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by  perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward  joe biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the president  i could make that claim also  legal proceedings are just now beginning  where are the missing military ballots in georgia  what happened to them  with the attack by the radical left dems on the republican senate  the presidency becomes even more important      has been able to render decisions in a matter of days  u   ken starr  former independent counsel      hopefully this will be corrected at the supreme court of the united states  also  these late ballots past election day are illegal  exactly what the president has been saying  the supreme court  in extraordinary circumstances         legislature  they just ignored that  ignored the constitution  now we bring it down to the counting houses  and outrageously  observers  who are the sentinels of integrity  amp  transparency  were excluded  pennsylvania has conducted itself in a horrible lawless way  and      u  this is what we know  we have to go back to the state level and how this morass came to be in the first instance  the governor  wolf  and the state supreme court  flagrantly violated the constitution of the u s  the power to set these rules and regulations is vested in the  u  philadelpiha has got a rotten history on election integrity  u     twitter is out of control  made possible through the government gift of section   i easily win the presidency of the united states with legal votes cast  the observers were not allowed  in any way  shape  or form  to do their job and therefore  votes accepted during this period must be determined to be illegal votes  u s  supreme court should decide  so now the democrats are working to gain control of the u s  senate through their actions on john james  david perdue  and more  would end the filibuster   u  life u      and would pack and rotate the

it u  s not the only factor  yet a big lost opportunity for some  treat it like tv  https   t co ovs  u   https   t co qitmxta   not sure if you read what i wrote above  messaging absolutely matters   and the attacks are more decisive when there u  s no deep canvassing happening  does your family u  s elected officials normally have year round deep canvassers in their community   katie porter and btw i u  m happy to cede ground on things that aren u  t working in some areas  but finger pointing is not gonna help  there u  s real workable  amp  productive paths here if the party is open to us 

 after all  i got here by beating a dem who outspent me   who i knew had bad polling  you can u  t just tell the black  brown   amp  youth organizers riding in to save us every election to be quiet or not have their reps champion them when they need us  or wonder why they don u  t show up for midterms when they u  re scolded for existing  esp when they u  re delivering victories  by the way if white communities are getting more comfortable w overt racism or  u  cultural resentment u    if that u  s what they u  re rebranding it now  it u  s only gonna get harder for poc turnout to save everyone 

real organizing  amp  strategy is needed that disarms bigotry  not avoids it  and on this hand wringing about slight poc increases for gop in some areas   this is also an area w answers 

but honestly when it comes to latinos the party u  s just never seriously made an effort  mexicans  central am  caribbean  chicanos   cubans are not the only impt community how do you make it less effective  invest in year round deep canvassing  data shows that this kind of work helps blunt the force of racial resentment at the polls 

if you u  re always running away from convos about race  then the only ppl owning it are gop  you u  ll lose  so the whole  u  progressivism is bad u   argument just doesn u  t have any compelling evidence that i u  ve seen 

when it comes to  u  defund u    amp   u  socialism u   attacks  people need to realize these are racial resentment attacks  you u  re not gonna make that go away  you can make it less effective  there are swing seat dem incumbents who cosponsored the green new deal  medicare for all  etc and if i u  m not mistaken every single one won re election  also  the decision to stop knocking doors is one people need to grapple with and analyze 

 and  never stopped and may very well have helped delivered a biden presidency bc of it https   t co  ideology   messaging are the spicy convos a lot of people jump to but sometimes it u  s about execution and technical capacity 

digital execution was not good  polls were off  ironically dccc banned the firms who are the best in the country at facebook bc they work w progressives  underinvestment across the board  some campaigns spent   on digital the week before the election  others who spent did so in very poor ways 

if i spent only   on tv the week before an election  amp  then blamed others after  you u  d ask questions  that u  s how it looks seeing this  there are folks running around on tv blaming progressivism for dem underperformance 

i was curious  so i decided to open the hood on struggling campaigns of candidates who are blaming progressives for their problems

hope you all are doing well and staying safe    oh hey  didn u  t see this  thanks for the update  u    if it makes you feel any better  i got  u  hostage video u   and your screencap is much more dashing  u   it is ironic that many claiming to  u  defend u   a saint no one attacked approached this matter w  such lack of grace or generosity 

instead of examining for truth  many jumped to irrational conclusions  amp  sprung to cast judgement  amp  condescension w o engaging the actual idea presented we have   statues and portraits in the capitol  almost all of them are of white men 

every single statue there could be of a canonized saint and that  still  doesn u  t change the fact that the erasure of women  amp  bipoc from american history is a feature of white supremacy  yep 

at no point did i say fr  damien was a bad figure   in fact  i explicitly stated that my observations weren u  t about litigating his or any individual statue

that u  s a really solid start for this being the first time this issue has been brought before congress 

we u  ve made great strides since  that  senate fb hearing  but we u  ve got a lot of room to still improve  when our legislative bodies aren u  t sufficiently responsive to tech  then that means we don u  t have the tools required to protect people 

this is partially why companies know way more about you than you may even be aware of   bc it u  s legal  and congress is struggling to keep up  some context for a few folks getting upset at this  congress is voting on legislation regarding twitch today 

it u  s totally fine if you don u  t know what twitch is  but tech literacy is becoming an growing need in congress so we can legislate to protect people u  s privacy  etc  imagine trying to explain to your colleagues who are members of congress what twitch is  u   this is awesome

 if you u  re a house member  amp  want your effort added just   me  

thread  u   u fe   it says right in the tweet that we should pause loan collections   not cancellation  though i support that too  but as a separate policy   that means people would still have to pay it back  

we can find ways to give working people liquidity in an emergency  too  not just wall st   i am looking forward to uniting behind the eventual nominee and defeating trump  but in this moment we have to be extra mindful of the attempts and flashy headlines that try to get us to jump to conclusions  my dms are open to you  amp  if you have a q again  feel free to reach out    i was discussing youth turnout 

bernie u  s campaign tried a strategy of blowing up youth turnout  it worked to an extent  but wasn u  t enough to get us past the post  what i  was  discussing were the  hour waits at polling locations  which can sometimes deter young people    hey fred  i deeply appreciate your work and advocacy on gun reform 

biden ran a great campaign and won michigan strongly  please keep in mind the strong attempts to divide our party at this time  if you look at actual the clip  i did not blame sanders u   loss to voter suppression  i u  ve been discussing policy responses for coronavirus  but there is plenty we can also do to care for each other  nyc 

  check on your neighbors  can be through the door 
  offer to run errands for the elderly
  tip  a lot  extra if you can
  donate to food pantries shelters etc we need to dramatically expand  u   testing and  processing  capacity 

it u  s imperative to our public health that everyone who needs a test can get it easily and for free as quickly as possible   no matter whether you u  re a sports star or a single parent  https   t co cbeibvr   when people say  u  why didn u  t young people turn out to vote  u     it u  s easy to blame young ppl condescendingly 

we should we acknowledge youth mobilization strategies coming short   but it u  s also wrong to completely ignore the fact that there are  waits on campus polling stations   i do not attribute the loss on voter suppression 

biden bested the night  fair  amp  square  however  anywhere  w  a multi hour wait to vote   whether in ga  tx  mi  or anywhere else   is a problem 

voter suppression primarily targets black voters   amp  young ppl can be impacted too  hey all  wanted to drop a u   for accountability 

i usually don u  t go on fox on principle  but misinformation about coronavirus has made me concerned about risk 

as a result i decided to go on  to discuss coronavirus response   make the case for paid leave  medicaid  etc want to know one major reason why south korea has had stellar rapid response and quickly produced  amp  scaled up to   tests day 

they have a single payer   system 

we don u  t 

please remember why it u  s so important for us to fight for healthcare as a human right  fyi  the amount that the fed just injected almost covers all student loan debt in the us 

there is absolutely no excuse for not pausing student debt collections  planning for mortgage  amp rent relief  etc 

we need to care for working people as much as we care for the stock market  https   t co it of course  as we know staying home is much easier said than done 

that u  s why it u  s imperative that we pass emergency measures like guaranteed healthcare  paid leave  eviction moratoriums   amp  more to protect people in the logistics of making that happen  right now  the question of social distancing isn u  t just  u  could i get sick  u    it u  s  u  could i unknowingly pass it to others  u  

you could be around immunocompromised people and not know it  if too many people get sick at once  it could overwhelm hospitals  amp  systems 

so stay home  https   t co lszpg this is not the time for half measures 

we need to take dramatic action now to stave off the worst public health  amp  economic affects 

that includes making moves on paid leave  debt relief  waiving work req u  s  guaranteeing healthcare  ubi  detention relief pretrial  elderly  imm  we should also consider measures on mortgage relief  the federal government should consider pausing collection on student loan debt  i find it amusing that gopers stalk my livestreams to obsess over any  amp  every word  bc i u  m  actually available  to constituent qs at  after a long day 

meanwhile  many gop electeds hide from constituents  amp  avoid town halls  maybe that u  s why they u  re so preoccupied w  mine  u   u   u   u   u fe  some are taking about  u   u fe unemployment insurance   amp  while good it u  s not nearly enough  there are enormous sectors of our economy  tipped workers  freelance  shift workers  who may not be  u  unemployed u   but whose lives are still dramatically disrupted to the point of eviction  etc right about now would be a great time to weigh emergency measures like 
  extending medicare medicaid coverage to all
  eviction freezes

i am thankful for so much this year  my friends  family  and loved ones  the blessing of good health   amp  the opportunity to serve our community and country 

gratitude is a practice  what are you grateful for this year   u   u fe  look out for those in politics who like to label themselves  u  fiscally responsible  u   yet only seem to care about the price of justice   not the cost of oppression 

everything has a price  and an unjust society is far costlier than one that invests in  amp  values all people  none of the politicians who brand themselves  u  fiscally responsible u   ever raise concern about rushing to shower ice  amp  cbp w   billions with  guardrails or oversight 

none of them ask about how we pay for corrupt contracts or mass incarceration 

ask yourself why that is  this is honestly one of the big reasons why the argument about  u  pay fors u   in healthcare  housing  etc so often are made in bad faith 

i see decisions made every day that cost the american public billions of dollars a year for bogus reasons and nobody asks how we pay for it    earlier this year  congress rushed to approve billions more   for ice   cbp 

i saw members voting yes w o even a summary of the bill  nobody cared then how we u  d pay for it 

now ice is setting up fake universities to trap students 

yet we were called radical for opposing it  abolish ice  https   t co  none of this is a critique on lawmakers who dial for dollars   they don u  t want to be doing it in the first place 

but to change this system  we must push hard to change the corrupting role of money in politics  and yes  those forces exist among all parties  our political system u  s reliance on huge sums of money has many negative impacts  but one of the largest is that it takes lawmakers u   time away from lawmaking 

that u  s a feature  not a flaw   the less time lawmakers have  the more special interests can slip in harmful provisions  instead  your support allows me to spend hours each day studying issues  amp  exposing abuse of power 

so while fox continues to laugh that i u  m  u  just a bartender  u   i u  ve spend the whole year studying big pharma  private equity  military contractors  and mark zuckerberg u  s shady deals  there is  of course  much more time for me to be fully present at my job  

in congress  this is a luxury  since i don u  t spend hours each day asking for money  i spend a lot more time legislating  studying   amp  preparing sitting in hearings 

this has cumulative effects over time  i intentionally built my campaign to rely on small dollar grassroots support w o any corporate    because i felt that u  s the best way to be accountable to everyday people 

it has impacted how i work in congress in powerful ways   ways i couldn u  t fully appreciate until i got here  while many try to belittle a progressive agenda that centers working people  amp  the public good  in truth it u  s more powerful than ever 

i haven u  t picked up a phone once this year to dial for dollars   amp  i don u  t meet w  corp lobbyists
